# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution (Layer 2)

**Base Layer**: constitution.base.md v1.1
**Domain Layer**: [none | fintech | healthcare | e-commerce | saas]
**Effective Date**: [DATE]

## How Layered Constitution Works

This is **Layer 2** (project-specific) of the constitution:

```
Layer 0: constitution.base.md ──────── 20 enterprise principles (READ-ONLY)
    ↓ inherits
Layer 1: constitution.domain.md ────── Domain-specific (fintech, healthcare, etc.)
    ↓ inherits
Layer 2: constitution.md (this file) ─ Your project overrides
```

**Rules**:
- You INHERIT all principles from Layer 0 (and Layer 1 if domain selected)
- You can STRENGTHEN principles (SHOULD → MUST) but NEVER weaken (MUST → SHOULD)
- You can ADD new project-specific principles
- You can REFINE parameters (e.g., coverage 80% → 90%)

---

## Quick Start

1. **Review base principles**: Read `constitution.base.md` to understand defaults
2. **Select domain** (optional): Copy `domains/[domain].md` to `constitution.domain.md`
3. **Add overrides below**: Strengthen or add principles as needed

---

## Strengthened Principles

<!--
Override base/domain principles here.
You can only strengthen (SHOULD → MUST) or tighten parameters.
Example:
-->

| Base ID | Original Level | New Level | Rationale |
|---------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| QUA-001 | SHOULD (80%) | MUST (90%) | Critical system, high coverage required |
| OBS-003 | SHOULD | MUST | Kubernetes deployment requires health checks |

---

## Project-Specific Principles

<!--
Add principles unique to your project.
Use format: PRJ-001, PRJ-002, etc.
-->

### PRJ-001: [Principle Name]

**Level**: MUST | SHOULD
**Applies to**: [scope]

[Description of the principle and its rationale]

**Validation**: [How to verify compliance]
**Violations**: [Severity - CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW]

---

### PRJ-002: [Principle Name]

**Level**: MUST | SHOULD
**Applies to**: [scope]

[Description]

**Validation**: [How to verify]
**Violations**: [Severity]

## Technology Constraints

<!-- Project-specific technology decisions that affect principles -->

| Category | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Language | [e.g., Python 3.11+] | [why] |
| Framework | [e.g., FastAPI] | [why] |
| Database | [e.g., PostgreSQL 15] | [why] |
| Cloud | [e.g., AWS] | [why] |

---

## Exceptions

<!--
Document any TEMPORARY exceptions to principles.
Exceptions must have expiration dates and remediation plans.
-->

| Principle ID | Exception | Expiration | Remediation Plan |
|--------------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| [ID] | [What is excepted] | [Date] | [How it will be fixed] |

---

## Governance

- This constitution is enforced by `/speckit.analyze` command
- MUST violations are CRITICAL severity and block implementation
- SHOULD violations are MEDIUM severity and require justification
- Amendments require team review and version update

## Effective Principles Summary

<!--
This section can be auto-generated by running:
/speckit.constitution --merge

It will show all active principles from all layers.
