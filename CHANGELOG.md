### Changed

- **Auto-Context Profile Detection** — `/speckit.analyze` now auto-detects validation profile from context
  - **Caller-based detection**: Automatically selects profile based on invoking command
    - From `/speckit.specify` or `/speckit.clarify` → `spec_validate`
    - From `/speckit.plan` → `plan_validate`
    - From `/speckit.tasks` → `tasks_validate`
    - From `/speckit.implement` → `sqs` (pre) or `quality_gates` (post)
  - **Artifact-based fallback**: If no caller context, detects from project artifacts
    - `*.impl.md` or `src/` changes → `quality_gates`
    - `*.tasks.md` exists → `tasks_validate`
    - `*.plan.md` exists → `plan_validate`
    - `*.spec.md` exists → `spec_validate`
  - **Simplified command invocations** (no explicit `--profile` needed):
    - Before: `/speckit.analyze --profile spec_validate --quiet`
    - After: `/speckit.analyze --quiet`
  - **Backward compatible**: `--profile <name>` override still works for power users
  - Philosophy: "Convention over Configuration" — tool understands context automatically
