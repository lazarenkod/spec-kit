        ## Reasoning Process (Think step-by-step):

        Step 1: Analyze Requirements
        - What are the core user goals from spec.md?
        - What constraints exist (device, accessibility, performance)?
        - What brand identity elements must we preserve?
        - What is the competitive landscape?

        Step 2: Consider Trade-offs
        - How do we balance innovation vs. familiar patterns?
        - What are the risks of ignoring competitor patterns?
        - How do we prioritize user needs vs. business goals?
        - What accessibility requirements are non-negotiable?

        Step 3: Apply Research Principles
        - What user research methods apply to this context?
        - How do we validate assumptions about user preferences?
        - What patterns have proven success in similar features?
        - How do we ensure brand consistency?

        ## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
        Reference: {{ANTI_PATTERNS}} (loaded at command level, ID: anti-patterns)
        
        **OPTIMIZATION**: Anti-patterns loaded once at command init, referenced by ID across all agents.
        Saves 1.5-2K tokens per agent × 10 agents = 6-8K total tokens.
        
        Apply as DO NOT constraints in all outputs.
        When researching patterns, explicitly flag any anti-patterns found in competitors.

        ## Context
        Feature: {{FEATURE_DIR}}
        Spec: {{FEATURE_DIR}}/spec.md
        
        **OPTIMIZATION v0.5.0**: Constitution context loaded at command level (ID: constitution-design-system)
        instead of individual agent extraction. Saves ~4K tokens across 15+ agent references.
        
        Design System (from {{CONSTITUTION_DESIGN_SYSTEM}}):
        - UX Quality Settings: {{UX_QUALITY}}
        - Brand & Audience: {{BRAND_AUDIENCE}}
        - Reference: constitution.md design_system block (preloaded)

        ## Task
        Research design context and gather inputs:
        1. Analyze spec.md for UI-related functional requirements
        2. Extract brand guidelines from constitution if available
        3. Read UX quality settings (usability_target, flow_complexity, design_a11y_level)
        4. Read brand/audience settings (brand_archetype, tone_of_voice, emotional_goal)
        5. Identify target user personas aligned with audience_sophistication level
        6. Research competitor UX patterns for similar features
        7. Gather demographic-specific patterns based on demographics_priority

        ## Output
        - Design brief with user needs, UX quality targets, and brand personality
        - Brand alignment notes including tone of voice and emotional goals
        - Competitor pattern analysis filtered by usability_target level
        - Demographic considerations (if demographics_priority specified)

        ## Reasoning Process (Think step-by-step):

        Step 1: Analyze Requirements
        - What existing patterns are already in the codebase?
        - What design tokens are currently being used?
        - What components can be reused vs. created new?
        - What inconsistencies exist in current patterns?

        Step 2: Consider Trade-offs
        - Should we refactor existing components or create new ones?
        - How do we balance consistency vs. feature-specific needs?
        - What is the cost of introducing new patterns?
        - How do we deprecate outdated patterns gracefully?

        Step 3: Apply Pattern Analysis Principles
        - What makes a pattern reusable and maintainable?
        - How do we ensure patterns scale across the application?
        - What documentation is needed for pattern adoption?
        - How do we measure pattern effectiveness?

        ## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
        Reference: {{ANTI_PATTERNS}} (loaded at command level, ID: anti-patterns)
        
        **OPTIMIZATION**: Anti-patterns loaded once at command init, referenced by ID across all agents.
        Apply as DO NOT constraints in all outputs.
        When analyzing existing patterns, flag violations of AP-VIS, AP-COMP, AP-LAY categories.

        ## Context
        Feature: {{FEATURE_DIR}}
        Existing Design System: specs/app-design/design_system.md (if exists)

        ## Task
        Analyze existing design patterns:
        1. Scan codebase for existing UI components
        2. Identify design system tokens already in use
        3. Document reusable patterns and components
        4. Note inconsistencies to address

        ## Output
        - Existing component inventory
        - Design token analysis
        - Pattern reuse recommendations

        ## Reasoning Process (Think step-by-step):

        Step 1: Analyze Requirements
        - What are the primary user tasks and goals?
        - What are the critical user flows that must work flawlessly?
        - What devices and contexts will users be in?
        - What accessibility requirements must be built in from the start?

        Step 2: Consider Trade-offs
        - How do we balance simplicity vs. power user features?
        - Should we use progressive disclosure or show everything upfront?
        - How do we balance mobile vs. desktop experience needs?
        - What accessibility trade-offs are acceptable (if any)?

        Step 3: Apply UX Design Principles
        - How does Fitts's Law apply to CTA and interactive element placement?
        - Where should we apply the principle of least surprise?
        - How do we maintain visual hierarchy across different screen sizes?
        - What feedback mechanisms are needed for user confidence?

        ## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
        Reference: {{ANTI_PATTERNS}} (loaded at command level, ID: anti-patterns)
        Apply as DO NOT constraints in all outputs.

        ## Reasoning Process (Think step-by-step):

        Step 1: Analyze Requirements
        - What brand identity elements must be preserved?
        - What visual hierarchy best serves the user goals?
        - What color contrast requirements exist (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)?
        - What existing patterns constrain our design choices?

        Step 2: Consider Trade-offs
        - Should we extend the existing palette or introduce new colors?
        - How do we balance visual interest vs. consistency?
        - What typography scale supports both readability and hierarchy?
        - Should we optimize for light mode, dark mode, or both equally?

        Step 3: Apply Visual Design Principles
        - How do we establish clear visual hierarchy through size, weight, and color?

        ## Reasoning Process (Think step-by-step):

        Step 1: Analyze Asset Requirements
        - What gameplay mechanics require visual assets?
        - What UI screens and elements are needed?
        - What environmental zones need unique assets?
        - What priority tiers ensure MVP vs. full launch coverage?

        Step 2: Consider Production Trade-offs
        - How do we balance asset count vs. memory budget?
        - Should we use asset variants or runtime recoloring?
        - How do we organize assets for efficient atlasing?
        - What level of detail is appropriate for mobile screens?

        Step 3: Apply Asset Production Principles
        - How do we ensure consistent naming conventions?
        - What resolution tiers support @1x/@2x/@3x devices?
        - How do we minimize draw calls through batching?
        - What asset reuse patterns reduce production workload?

## Prefetch Phase [REF:PF-001]

**Speculative parallel load** of all potentially-needed files BEFORE any conditional logic:

```text
# PREFETCH BATCH (single message, all Read calls in parallel)
Read IN PARALLEL:
- `memory/constitution.md`
- `templates/shared/core/language-loading.md`
- `templates/shared/complexity-scoring.md`
- `FEATURE_DIR/spec.md` (required - will be resolved after script runs)
- `specs/concept.md` (if exists)
- `specs/app-design/design-system.md` (if exists)
- `templates/design-tokens/*.md` (if directory exists)

CACHE all results with session lifetime.
REPORT: "Prefetched {N} files in {T}ms"
```

**Why prefetch?** Loading 5-8 files in parallel (300ms) vs sequential (2-3s) saves 2+ seconds per command invocation.

---

## Purpose

This command creates **visual and interaction specifications** for UI-heavy features. It bridges the gap between functional requirements (spec.md) and implementation by defining:

1. **Visual Language**: Design tokens, colors, typography, spacing
2. **Component Specifications**: States, variants, accessibility, responsive behavior
3. **Screen Flows**: User interface sequences with component mapping
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Animations, transitions, feedback mechanisms
5. **Accessibility Requirements**: WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

**When to use**:
- Feature has significant user interface (dashboards, forms, wizards)
- Multiple UI components need consistent styling
- Accessibility is a priority
- Design handoff to developers is needed
- Complex interactions (drag-drop, real-time updates, animations)

**When to skip**:
- API-only features
- CLI tools
- Background services
- Simple CRUD with minimal UI

## Design System Generation Mode

When `--design-system` flag is passed OR no spec file exists, generate a complete design system from brand inputs.

### Brand Input Collection

```text
IF MODE == "design_system_generation":

  1. COLLECT brand inputs (interactive or from constitution.md):

     Required:
     - brand_name: "Your company/product name"
     - primary_color: "#hex or color name"
     - product_type: saas | marketing | mobile | admin

     Optional:

  2. IF brand inputs not provided interactively:
     READ constitution.md → design_system block
     EXTRACT brand values

  3. COLLECT extended design preferences (interactive):
     {{include: shared/design-questionnaire.md}}

     Use AskUserQuestion tool to collect preferences in batches:

### Design System Generation Workflow

```text
IF MODE == "design_system_generation":

  Step DS-1: Load Preset
  ─────────────────────
  1. READ templates/shared/design-system-presets.md
  2. FIND preset matching product_type
  3. APPLY preset defaults as base

  Step DS-2: Generate Color Palette
  ─────────────────────────────────
  FROM primary_color:
  1. Generate color scale (50-950):
     - 50-100: Tints (for backgrounds)
     - 200-400: Light variants
     - 500: Primary (input)
     - 600-800: Dark variants
     - 900-950: Shades (for text)

  2. Generate semantic colors:
     - primary: input color
     - secondary: complementary or neutral
     - accent: analogous or triadic
     - success: green family (#22C55E default)
     - warning: amber family (#F59E0B default)
     - error: red family (#EF4444 default)
     - info: blue family (#3B82F6 default)

  3. Generate neutral palette:
     - Tinted neutrals based on primary undertone
     - Or pure gray if style_keywords includes "minimal"

  4. Validate contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)

  Step DS-3: Generate Typography
  ──────────────────────────────
  FROM font_preference OR preset:
  1. SELECT font pairing:
     - sans-serif: Inter, system-ui
     - serif: Georgia, Merriweather
     - mono: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code
     - custom: user-specified

  2. GENERATE type scale (1.25 ratio):
     - display: 3rem / 700
     - h1: 2.25rem / 700
     - h2: 1.875rem / 600
     - h3: 1.5rem / 600
     - h4: 1.25rem / 600
     - body: 1rem / 400
     - small: 0.875rem / 400
     - caption: 0.75rem / 400

  Step DS-4: Generate Spacing & Layout
  ────────────────────────────────────
  FROM preset.spacing_scale:
  1. GENERATE spacing tokens:
     - 0: 0
     - px: 1px
     - 0.5: 2px
     - 1: 4px (base)
     - 2: 8px
     - 3: 12px
     - 4: 16px
     - 5: 20px
     - 6: 24px
     - 8: 32px
     - 10: 40px
     - 12: 48px
     - 16: 64px

  2. GENERATE layout tokens:
     - container widths
     - breakpoints
     - grid columns

  Step DS-5: Generate Component Library
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  FROM preset.components + core components:
  1. FOR EACH component:
     - Generate specification
     - Define variants
     - Set default styling
     - Configure for preset type

  2. PRIORITY order:
     - Core: Button, Input, Select, Checkbox, Radio
     - Layout: Card, Modal, Drawer, Tabs
     - Feedback: Toast, Alert, Badge, Progress
     - Preset-specific: from preset.components

  Step DS-6: Generate Output Files
  ────────────────────────────────
  OUTPUT:
  - design-system/tokens.css      # CSS custom properties
  - design-system/tokens.json     # JSON format
  - design-system/tailwind.config.js  # Tailwind theme
  - design-system/theme.ts        # TypeScript theme object
  - design-system/README.md       # Usage documentation
```

### Storybook Auto-Generation

```text
IF storybook.auto_generate:

  Step SB-1: Generate Storybook Configuration
  ───────────────────────────────────────────
  CREATE .storybook/main.ts:
  - Framework: @storybook/react-vite (or detected framework)
  - Addons: essentials, a11y, interactions
  - Stories glob pattern

  CREATE .storybook/preview.ts:
  - Import design tokens CSS
  - Configure viewports (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Configure dark mode toggle
  - Set default background

  Step SB-2: Generate Component Stories
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  FOR EACH component in design-system:

    CREATE stories/{Component}.stories.tsx:

    ```typescript
    import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';
    import { {Component} } from '../components/{component}';

    const meta: Meta<typeof {Component}> = {
      title: 'Components/{Component}',
      component: {Component},
      tags: ['autodocs'],
      argTypes: {
        // Generated from component variants
      },
    };

    export default meta;
    type Story = StoryObj<typeof meta>;

    // Default story
    export const Default: Story = {
      args: {
        // Default props
      },
    };

    // Variant stories
    export const {Variant}: Story = {
      args: {
        variant: '{variant}',
      },
    };

    // State stories
    export const Disabled: Story = {
      args: {
        disabled: true,
      },
    };
    ```

  Step SB-3: Generate Documentation
  ─────────────────────────────────
  CREATE stories/Introduction.mdx:
  - Design system overview
  - Token usage guide
  - Component inventory
  - Accessibility guidelines

  CREATE stories/Colors.mdx:
  - Color palette visualization
  - Contrast ratio table
  - Usage guidelines

  CREATE stories/Typography.mdx:
  - Type scale visualization
  - Font specimens
  - Usage examples
```

### Phase 0: Validation & Concept Parsing

```text
IF MODE == "concept_design":

  1. LOCATE concept file:
     - CHECK specs/concept.md
     - FALLBACK ./concept.md
     - ERROR if not found

  2. PARSE concept.md:
     EXTRACT:
       - cqs_score: Concept Quality Score (warn if < 60)
       - feature_hierarchy: EPIC-NNN.FNN.SNN tree
       - user_journeys: J000, J001, ... with steps
       - personas: JTBD, pain points, device preferences
       - ux_foundations: AUTH, ERROR, LAYOUT, NAV, FTUE, FEEDBACK, ADMIN
       - execution_order: Wave 1, Wave 2, Wave 3+
       - technical_hints: Domain entities, API surface
       - glossary: UI labels, form field names

  3. QUALITY GATE:
     IF cqs_score >= 80:
       LOG "✅ Production-quality concept (CQS: {cqs_score})"
       PROCEED with full generation
     ELIF cqs_score >= 60:
       LOG "⚠️ Concept has gaps (CQS: {cqs_score}). Proceeding with warnings."
       PROCEED with warnings enabled
     ELSE:
       LOG "⚠️ Concept Quality Score below threshold (CQS: {cqs_score})"
       PROMPT "Continue anyway? [y/N]"
       IF user declines: EXIT
```

### Phase 1: Design System (Product Designer Agent)

```text
IF WAVE == 1 OR WAVE == "all":

  1. READ constitution.md → design_system block
     EXTRACT brand inputs (colors, typography, style keywords)

### Phase 5: Wave-by-Wave Feature Design

```text
# Wave selection determines which features to design

IF WAVE == 1:
  FEATURES = features from "Wave 1: Foundation" in execution_order
ELIF WAVE == 2:
  FEATURES = features from "Wave 2: Experience" in execution_order
ELIF WAVE == 3:
  FEATURES = features from "Wave 3+: Business" in execution_order
ELIF WAVE == "all":
  FEATURES = all features from execution_order

FOR each feature IN FEATURES:

  1. EXTRACT from concept.md:
     - feature_id: EPIC-NNN.FNN
     - stories: S01, S02, ...
     - acceptance_criteria
     - related_journeys

  2. MAP stories to screens:

     FOR each story:
       IDENTIFY:
         - Primary screen(s)
         - Modal/overlay needs
         - State variations (empty, loading, error, success)

  3. GENERATE feature-design.md:

     INCLUDE:
       ## Feature: {feature_name}
       **ID**: {feature_id}

       | Stories | S01, S02, S03 |

  4. OUTPUT: specs/app-design/waves/wave-{N}/{feature_id}-design.md
```

### Phase 6: Motion System (Motion Designer Agent)

```text
IF WAVE == 1 OR WAVE == "all":

  1. ANALYZE journeys for transition needs:
     - Page-to-page transitions
     - Modal/overlay animations
     - Loading state animations

  2. GENERATE motion-system.md:

     INCLUDE:
       ## Animation Tokens
       | Token | Value | Usage |
       |-------|-------|-------|
       | duration-fast | 150ms | Micro-interactions |
       | duration-normal | 300ms | Page transitions |
       | easing-standard | cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) | Default |

       ## Page Transitions
       | From | To | Animation |
       |------|-----|-----------|
       | / | /dashboard | Slide left + fade |
       | any | modal | Scale up + backdrop |

       ## Micro-Interactions
       [Reference templates/shared/animation-presets/micro-interactions.md]

  3. OUTPUT: specs/app-design/motion/motion-system.md

  4. GENERATE transitions.md:

     INCLUDE:
       ## Journey Transitions
       FOR each journey:
         Document step-to-step transitions
         Map to page transition patterns

  5. OUTPUT: specs/app-design/motion/transitions.md
```

### Phase 7: Component Inventory

```text
IF WAVE == 1 OR WAVE == "all":

  1. AGGREGATE components from all design files:
     - Foundations → base components
     - Journeys → flow components
     - Features → feature-specific components

  2. DEDUPLICATE and categorize:
     - Primitives (Button, Input, Text, Icon)
     - Layout (Card, Container, Grid, Stack)
     - Navigation (NavBar, Tabs, Breadcrumb)
     - Feedback (Toast, Alert, Modal, Progress)
     - Data Display (Table, List, Chart)
     - Forms (Form, FormField, Select, Checkbox)
     - Feature-specific (unique to this app)

  3. GENERATE inventory.md:

     INCLUDE:
       ## Component Inventory
       | Component | Category | Usage Count | Sources |
       |-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
       | Button | Primitive | 47 | All foundations, all features |
       | DataTable | Data Display | 12 | EPIC-001.F02, EPIC-003.F01 |

       ## Shared Component Needs
       Components used 3+ times → candidate for shared spec

       ## Implementation Priority
       1. Primitives (Week 1)
       2. Layout + Navigation (Week 2)
       3. Forms + Feedback (Week 3)
       4. Feature-specific (Per wave)

  4. OUTPUT: specs/app-design/components/inventory.md
```

### Phase 8: Quality Validation & Index Generation

```text
ALWAYS (after any wave completion):

  1. CALCULATE App-DQS (Design Quality Score):

     AGGREGATE scores from:
       - Design system completeness
       - Foundation coverage
       - Journey flow completeness
       - Feature wireframe quality
       - Traceability coverage

     FORMULA:
       App-DQS = (
         design_system_score * 0.15 +
         foundations_score * 0.20 +
         journeys_score * 0.20 +
         features_score * 0.30 +
         traceability_score * 0.15
       )

  2. VALIDATE traceability:

     CHECK:
       - Every concept feature has design file
       - Every journey step has screen reference
       - Every UXF scenario has design coverage

     REPORT gaps if any

  3. GENERATE/UPDATE index.md:

     INCLUDE:
       ## Application Design Overview

       **Concept**: {concept_name}
       **CQS**: {cqs_score}
       **App-DQS**: {app_dqs_score}
       **Generated**: {timestamp}
       **Wave**: {current_wave} of {total_waves}

       ## Design Artifacts

       | Artifact | Status | DQS | Link |
       |----------|--------|-----|------|
       | Design System | ✅ Complete | 92 | [design-system.md](design-system.md) |

       | Wave 1 Features | ✅ Complete | 90 | [waves/wave-1/](waves/wave-1/) |
       | Wave 2 Features | ⏳ Pending | - | - |

       ## Traceability Matrix

       | Concept ID | Design Artifact | Coverage |
       |------------|-----------------|----------|
       | EPIC-001.F01 | waves/wave-1/EPIC-001.F01-design.md | 100% |
       | J000 | journeys/J000-golden-path.md | 100% |
       | UXF-AUTH | foundations/auth-design.md | 100% |

       ## Next Steps
       - [ ] Run /speckit.preview to generate interactive preview
       - [ ] Review with stakeholders
       - [ ] Run /speckit.design --concept --wave 2 for next wave

## Alternative Design Mode

When `--all-alternatives` or `--alternative N` flag is passed, generate design specifications for concept alternatives. This enables visual comparison of different product strategies before committing to implementation.

{{include: shared/alternative-parser.md}}

### CLI Arguments

```text
Parse arguments for:
- `--alternative <N>` — Generate design for specific alternative (1-5)
- `--all-alternatives` — Generate designs for ALL alternatives from concept.md
- `--variant <name>` — Generate design for variant (MINIMAL/BALANCED/AMBITIOUS)
- `--all-variants` — Generate designs for all 3 scope variants
- `--compare` — Generate visual comparison matrix alongside designs
- `--quick` — Use default design preferences, skip questionnaire
```

### Workflow: All Alternatives

```text
IF MODE == "alternative_design" AND --all-alternatives:

  1. LOCATE and PARSE concept.md:
     concept_path = find_concept_md()  # specs/concept.md or ./concept.md
     IF NOT exists(concept_path):
       ERROR "concept.md not found. Run /speckit.concept first."

     alternatives = parse_alternatives(concept_content)
     IF alternatives.length == 0:
       ERROR "No Product Alternatives found in concept.md."

  2. COLLECT design preferences (once, apply to all):
     IF NOT --quick:
       design_preferences = collect_design_questionnaire()
     ELSE:
       design_preferences = DEFAULT_PREFERENCES

  3. FOR each alternative in alternatives:
     strategy_slug = slugify(alternative.strategy_type)  # e.g., "conventional"
     output_dir = "specs/app-design/alternatives/alt-{N}-{strategy_slug}/"

     a) GENERATE overview.md:
        - Alternative name and vision
        - Strategy type explanation
        - Score breakdown (4 dimensions /40)
        - Core features list (5-7 epics)
        - Pros/Cons summary

     b) GENERATE design-system.md:
        - Apply design_preferences tokens
        - Customize based on strategy type:
          * "Disruptive" → bolder colors, larger contrast
          * "Minimal" → minimal palette, smaller spacing
          * "Premium" → richer shadows, refined typography
          * "Platform" → modular, extensible tokens

     c) FOR each epic in alternative.core_features:
        GENERATE features/{epic_id}-design.md:
          - Feature overview with traceability to EPIC-xxx
          - Key screens wireframes (ASCII or visual)
          - Component specifications
          - User flow diagram

     d) GENERATE screens/:
        - Home/Dashboard screen
        - Key feature screens
        - Common patterns (auth, errors, empty states)

  4. GENERATE comparison.md:
     - Side-by-side comparison table
     - Feature matrix (which alternative has what)
     - Score comparison chart
     - Visual style comparison thumbnails
     - Recommendation based on scores
```

### Workflow: Single Alternative

```text
IF MODE == "alternative_design" AND --alternative N:

  1. PARSE alternatives from concept.md
  2. FIND alternative with number == N
     IF NOT found:
       ERROR "Alternative {N} not found. Available: 1-{max}"

  3. GENERATE design for single alternative:
     - Same process as all-alternatives but for one
     - Output to: specs/app-design/alternatives/alt-{N}-{strategy}/
```

### Workflow: Variants (MINIMAL/BALANCED/AMBITIOUS)

```text
IF MODE == "variant_design":

  1. PARSE variants from concept.md:
     variants = parse_variants(concept_content)
     IF variants.length == 0:
       ERROR "No Concept Variants found. Ensure MINIMAL/BALANCED/AMBITIOUS sections exist."

  2. FOR each variant in [MINIMAL, BALANCED, AMBITIOUS]:
     output_dir = "specs/app-design/variants/{variant.name}/"

     a) EXTRACT features for this variant:
        - MINIMAL: MUST_HAVE features only
        - BALANCED: MUST_HAVE + high-impact SHOULD_HAVE
        - AMBITIOUS: All features

     b) GENERATE design-system.md:
        - Same base tokens
        - Variant-specific component set

     c) FOR each feature in variant.features:
        GENERATE feature design spec

  3. GENERATE comparison.md:
     | Dimension | MINIMAL | BALANCED | AMBITIOUS |
     |-----------|:-------:|:--------:|:---------:|
     | Features | 8 | 14 | 22 |
     | Screens | 12 | 24 | 40 |
     | Complexity | Low | Medium | High |
```

### Mockup Generation Workflow

```text
IF MODE == "mockup_generation":

  # Load automation modules
  READ templates/shared/stitch-integration.md
  READ templates/shared/stitch-prompts.md
  READ templates/shared/stitch-selectors.md

  # Execute workflow phases
  CALL stitch_main():

    Phase 0: Preflight Check
    ────────────────────────
    - Verify Playwright installation
    - Check Chromium browser available
    - Validate session directory
    - Check rate limits (350/month standard, 50/month experimental)

    Phase 1: Authentication
    ───────────────────────
    IF MOCKUP_MODE == "reauth" OR no valid session:
      - Launch Playwright with persistent context
      - Navigate to stitch.withgoogle.com
      - Prompt user: "Please sign in to Google in the browser window"
      - Wait for successful authentication
      - Save session to .speckit/stitch/session/
    ELSE:
      - Load existing session
      - Verify session validity

    Phase 2: Wireframe Discovery
    ────────────────────────────
    SCAN design artifacts based on MOCKUP_SCOPE:
      IF MOCKUP_SCOPE == "app":
        - specs/app-design/foundations/*.md
        - specs/app-design/waves/**/*-design.md
        - specs/app-design/journeys/*.md
      ELIF MOCKUP_SCOPE == "feature":
        - Current feature design.md

    FOR each wireframe:
      EXTRACT:
        - ASCII art block
        - Screen name
        - Component list
        - Design system tokens

    IF MOCKUP_SCREENS != "all":
      FILTER wireframes to specified screens

    Phase 3: Prompt Generation
    ──────────────────────────
    FOR each wireframe:
      READ templates/shared/stitch-prompts.md
      CALL stitch_generate_prompt(wireframe):
        - Detect screen type (login, dashboard, form, etc.)
        - Load appropriate template
        - Enrich with design system context
        - Apply persona preferences
        - Save prompt to .speckit/stitch/prompts-cache/

    IF MOCKUP_MODE == "manual":
      GENERATE manual-generation-guide.md
      LOG "📝 Prompts generated. See manual guide for instructions."
      EXIT

    Phase 4: Stitch Generation Pipeline
    ────────────────────────────────────
    FOR each prompt:
      CALL stitch_generate_mockup(prompt):
        - Navigate to Stitch
        - Locate and fill prompt input
        - Click generate button
        - Wait for generation (timeout: 60s)
        - Handle errors (retry once, then skip)

    Phase 5: Export Pipeline
    ────────────────────────
    FOR each successful generation:
      CALL stitch_export_html():
        - Click Export button
        - Select HTML/Tailwind format
        - Copy code output
        - Save to stitch-output.html/css

      CALL stitch_export_screenshots():
        - Capture canvas at 1440px (desktop)
        - Resize to 375px
        - Capture mobile view
        - Save PNGs

      CALL stitch_export_figma():
        - Click "Copy to Figma" if available
        - Save clipboard content to figma-clipboard.json

    Phase 6: Gallery Generation
    ───────────────────────────
    - Generate per-feature index.html galleries
    - Generate master index.html
    - Include side-by-side wireframe vs mockup

    Phase 7: Quality Report
    ───────────────────────
    CALL stitch_generate_report():
      - Summary table (status, exports, prompt match)
      - Rate limit remaining
      - Failed screens list
      - Manual fallback guide if needed
```

### Selector Audit Mode (`--audit-selectors`)

The `--audit-selectors` flag runs a diagnostic mode that tests all Stitch UI selectors without generating mockups. This is useful for:

- **Troubleshooting**: When mockup generation fails, identify which selectors are broken
- **UI Change Detection**: After Google updates Stitch, quickly see what changed
- **Maintenance**: Periodically verify all selectors are still working
- **Debugging**: Get detailed info about which selector variants work

#### Usage

```bash
# Basic audit (tests all 26 selectors)
/speckit.design --mockup --audit-selectors

# With debug mode for verbose output
/speckit.design --mockup --audit-selectors --debug
```

---

## Feature Design Mode

When spec file exists (default mode), create visual specs for the feature.

## Outline

0. **Load project language setting**:

   Read `/memory/constitution.md` and extract the `language` value from the Project Settings table.

   ```text
   IF Project Settings section exists AND language row found:
     ARTIFACT_LANGUAGE = extracted value (e.g., "ru", "en", "de")
   ELSE:
     ARTIFACT_LANGUAGE = "en" (default)

   Apply language rules from templates/shared/language-context.md:
   - Generate all prose content in ARTIFACT_LANGUAGE
   - Keep IDs, technical terms (WCAG, CSS, ARIA), and code in English
   ```

   Report: "Generating design specification in {LANGUAGE_NAME} ({ARTIFACT_LANGUAGE})..."

0.5. **Figma Import** (Optional):

   ```text
   IF figma_import.enabled AND NOT --no-figma flag:

     1. Check FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable
        IF not set:
          LOG "⚠️ FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN not set, skipping Figma import"
          SKIP to Step 1

     2. Extract Figma file key from spec.md Design System field:
        PATTERN: "figma.com/(file|design)/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)"
        IF no Figma URL found:
          LOG "ℹ️ No Figma URL in spec.md Design System field"
          SKIP to Step 1

     3. Call Figma API:
        GET https://api.figma.com/v1/files/{file_key}
        Headers: X-Figma-Token: {FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN}

     4. Extract design tokens:
        - Colors: document.styles WHERE type="FILL"
          → Map to Color Palette table (name, hex, rgb, semantic role)
        - Typography: document.styles WHERE type="TEXT"
          → Map to Typography Scale (family, size, weight, line-height)
        - Effects: document.styles WHERE type="EFFECT"
          → Map to Shadow System (name, CSS value)

     5. Extract components (if extract includes "components"):
        - Component sets: document.componentSets
          → Generate Component Specifications skeleton
        - Variants: component.variants
          → Map to States table (default, hover, active, disabled)

     6. Generate FIGMA_IMPORT_REPORT:
        ```
        ## Figma Import Report
        - File: {file_name} ({file_key})
        - Colors extracted: {count}
        - Typography styles: {count}
        - Components: {count}
        - Icons: {count}
        ```

     7. Mark imported entries with <!-- figma-sync --> comment
        for future re-import (non-destructive merge)

   ELSE:
     LOG "Figma import disabled or --no-figma flag set"
   ```

   Read `templates/shared/figma-import.md` for detailed Figma API mapping rules.

0.75. **Component Library Setup** (shadcn/ui Default):

   **shadcn/ui is the default component library for all React/Next.js projects.**

   ```text
   TRIGGER: design_system.framework in constitution.md is "none" or not configured

   # Priority order:
   # 1. --library flag (explicit override)
   # 2. Existing constitution.md config
   # 3. Default: shadcn/ui (for React/Next.js)

   IF --library flag passed:
     selected_library = flag_value  # e.g., --library mui, --library vuetify
     LOG "📚 Using specified library: {selected_library}"

     SKIP to Step 1

   IF --no-recommendation flag passed:
     LOG "ℹ️ Component library setup disabled"
     SKIP to Step 1
   ```

   **Step 0.75.1: Detect UI Framework**

   ```text
   # PARALLEL READ for performance (see templates/shared/core/parallel-loading.md)
   1-2. Read IN PARALLEL:
        - spec.md → "Framework Requirements" table
        - constitution.md → "Technology Constraints" table

   From spec.md:
     - Look for: React, Next.js, Vue, Nuxt, Angular, Svelte, SvelteKit
     - Check if TypeScript mentioned (tsx, ts, TypeScript)

   From constitution.md:
     - Find "UI Framework" row
     - Extract value: React | Vue | Angular | Svelte | None

   3. Determine framework:
      IF constitution.md has explicit UI Framework:
        ui_framework = constitution_value
      ELIF spec.md has Framework Requirements:
        ui_framework = detected_from_spec
      ELSE:
        ui_framework = "unknown"

   4. Detect TypeScript:
      IF "typescript" OR "tsx" in spec.md Framework Requirements:
        typescript_enabled = true
   ```

   **Step 0.75.2: Select Library (Auto-Default to shadcn/ui)**

   ```text
   # DEFAULT: shadcn/ui for React/Next.js projects
   IF ui_framework IN ["React", "Next.js"] OR typescript_enabled:
     selected_library = "shadcn/ui"
     LOG "✓ Using shadcn/ui (default for React/Next.js)"

   # Alternative frameworks get appropriate defaults
   ELIF ui_framework == "Vue" OR ui_framework == "Nuxt":
     selected_library = "vuetify"
     LOG "✓ Using Vuetify (default for Vue.js)"

   ELIF ui_framework == "Angular":
     selected_library = "angular-material"
     LOG "✓ Using Angular Material (default for Angular)"

   ELIF ui_framework == "Svelte" OR ui_framework == "SvelteKit":
     selected_library = "skeleton"
     LOG "✓ Using Skeleton UI (default for Svelte)"

   ELSE:
     # Fallback: still default to shadcn/ui
     selected_library = "shadcn/ui"
     LOG "ℹ️ Framework not detected, using shadcn/ui as default"
   ```

   **Step 0.75.3: Auto-Apply Preset**

   ```text
   # Load preset from design-system-presets.md
   Read templates/shared/design-system-presets.md
   IF selected_library == "shadcn/ui":
     Read templates/shared/shadcn-registry.md  # Component reference

   preset = find_preset(selected_library)

   IF preset exists:
     # Auto-apply without confirmation (streamlined flow)
     1. Load preset YAML
     2. Update design_system block in constitution.md:
        - framework: {selected_library}
        - theme: {preset.theme}
        - components: {preset.components}

     3. LOG output:

   ELSE:
     LOG "⚠️ No preset found for {selected_library}. Using custom tokens."
   ```

   **Step 0.75.4: Skip Conditions**

   ```text
   Skip this step when:
   - design_system.framework already configured (not "none")
   - UI Framework explicitly set to "None" in Technology Constraints
   - Backend-only project (no Frontend markers in Framework Requirements)
   - --no-recommendation flag passed

   When skipped, output:
   "Step 0.75: Component Library Setup - Skipped ({reason})"
   ```

   **--library Flag Reference** (Framework Presets)

   ```text
   Override the default library:

   /speckit.design --library shadcn   # shadcn/ui (default)
   /speckit.design --library mui      # Material UI
   /speckit.design --library vuetify  # Vuetify (Vue.js)
   /speckit.design --library bootstrap # Bootstrap
   /speckit.design --library angular-material # Angular Material
   /speckit.design --library skeleton # Skeleton UI (Svelte)
   /speckit.design --library tailwind # Tailwind CSS only (no components)
   ```

   Read `templates/shared/library-recommendations.md` for detailed framework→library mapping.
   Read `templates/shared/shadcn-registry.md` for shadcn/ui component reference (60+ components).

   **--aesthetic Flag Reference** (Aesthetic Presets - NEW v0.0.123!)

   ```text
   Apply brand-inspired visual styles:

   /speckit.design --aesthetic linear    # Linear.app (clean, minimal, keyboard-first)
   /speckit.design --aesthetic stripe    # Stripe (professional, fintech-grade)
   /speckit.design --aesthetic vercel    # Vercel (modern, bold, dark-friendly)

   Coming in v0.0.124:
   /speckit.design --aesthetic notion    # Notion (warm, approachable)
   /speckit.design --aesthetic apple     # Apple HIG (premium, refined)
   /speckit.design --aesthetic airbnb    # Airbnb (friendly, travel-inspired)
   /speckit.design --aesthetic github    # GitHub (developer-focused)
   /speckit.design --aesthetic slack     # Slack (vibrant, playful)
   /speckit.design --aesthetic figma     # Figma (creative, colorful)

   Combine with framework for best results:
   /speckit.design --library shadcn --aesthetic linear
   ```

   Read `templates/shared/design-aesthetic-presets.md` for complete aesthetic preset specifications.

   **Token Priority**: Custom overrides → Aesthetic → Framework → Defaults

   **Token Resolution Logic** (Dual-Preset System)

   ```python
   def resolve_design_tokens(constitution_config):
       """
       Priority: custom overrides → aesthetic → framework → defaults

       Aesthetic presets control VISUAL tokens only:
       - colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows, motion

       Framework presets control STRUCTURAL tokens:
       - component mappings, base tokens
       """

       resolved = {}

       # Step 1: Framework preset (base layer)
       if constitution_config.get('framework'):
           framework = load_preset('design-system-presets.md', framework_name)
           resolved = deep_merge(resolved, framework['theme'])

       # Step 2: Aesthetic preset (overrides visual tokens)
       if constitution_config.get('aesthetic'):
           aesthetic = load_preset('design-aesthetic-presets.md', aesthetic_name)
           # Only merge visual tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows, motion)
           # NOT component mappings (those come from framework only)
           visual_tokens = {
               'colors': aesthetic['theme']['colors'],
               'typography': aesthetic['theme']['typography'],
               'spacing': aesthetic['theme']['spacing'],
               'radii': aesthetic['theme']['radii'],
               'shadows': aesthetic['theme']['shadows'],
               'motion': aesthetic['theme']['motion']
           }
           resolved = deep_merge(resolved, visual_tokens)

       # Step 3: Custom overrides (highest priority)
       if constitution_config.get('theme'):
           resolved = deep_merge(resolved, constitution_config['theme'])

       return resolved
   ```

   **Usage Examples:**

   ```yaml
   # Framework only (component structure, default colors)
   design_system:
     framework: "shadcn/ui"

   # Aesthetic only (visual style, no components)
   design_system:
     aesthetic: "linear"

   # Both (RECOMMENDED - component structure + brand style)
   design_system:
     framework: "shadcn/ui"
     aesthetic: "linear"

   # With custom overrides (highest priority)
   design_system:
     framework: "shadcn/ui"
     aesthetic: "linear"
     theme:
       colors:
         primary: "#ff0000"  # Custom red overrides Linear purple
   ```

1. **Initialize design document**:
   - Run script `{SCRIPT}` to verify spec.md exists
   - Create `specs/[NNN-feature]/design.md` from `templates/design-template.md`
   - If design.md exists, load for update (no overwrite)

2. **Design Discovery** (analyze context):

   ```text
   FROM spec.md extract:
   - User personas and their device preferences
   - Functional requirements with UI implications
   - Acceptance scenarios involving visual elements
   - Edge cases affecting display states

   DETERMINE:
   - Primary platform: web / mobile / desktop / responsive
   - Interaction complexity: simple / moderate / complex
   - Accessibility tier: WCAG 2.1 A / AA / AAA
   - Design system: new / existing / extend
   ```

3. **Visual Language Definition**:

   ### Color Palette

   ```text
   Define semantic color tokens:
   - Primary: brand color for CTAs, links
   - Secondary: supporting actions
   - Accent: highlights, notifications
   - Semantic: success, warning, error, info
   - Neutral: backgrounds, borders, text

   FOR EACH color:
   - Light mode value
   - Dark mode value (if applicable)
   - Contrast ratio validation (≥4.5:1 for text)
   ```

   ### Typography Scale

   ```text
   Define type scale:
   - Display: hero text, marketing
   - Headings: h1-h6 hierarchy
   - Body: primary reading text
   - Caption: secondary info, labels
   - Code: monospace for technical content

   FOR EACH level:
   - Font family
   - Size (rem/px)
   - Weight
   - Line height
   - Letter spacing (if needed)
   ```

   ### Spacing System

   ```text
   Define spacing scale (4px base recommended):
   - xs: 4px   (0.25rem)
   - sm: 8px   (0.5rem)
   - md: 16px  (1rem)
   - lg: 24px  (1.5rem)
   - xl: 32px  (2rem)
   - 2xl: 48px (3rem)
   - 3xl: 64px (4rem)

   Apply consistently:
   - Component padding
   - Stack gaps
   - Section margins
   ```

   ### Icon System

   ```text
   Define icon approach:
   - Library: Lucide / Heroicons / Phosphor / custom
   - Sizes: sm (16px), md (20px), lg (24px), xl (32px)
   - Style: outline / solid / duotone
   - Color inheritance: currentColor / fixed
   ```

4. **Component Inventory**:

   ```text
   FROM spec.md requirements, identify needed components:

   FOR EACH component:
   1. Purpose and user value
   2. States: default, hover, active, focus, disabled, loading, error, success
   3. Variants: size (sm/md/lg), style (primary/secondary/ghost)
   4. Anatomy: sub-elements and their relationships
   5. Accessibility:
      - ARIA role
      - Keyboard interaction
      - Focus management
      - Screen reader announcements
   6. Responsive behavior:
      - Mobile: touch targets ≥44px, gestures
      - Tablet: hover states, larger touch
      - Desktop: hover, keyboard shortcuts
   ```

   **Common Components to Consider**:
   - Forms: Input, Select, Checkbox, Radio, Toggle, DatePicker
   - Actions: Button, IconButton, Link, Menu
   - Layout: Card, Modal, Drawer, Tabs, Accordion
   - Feedback: Toast, Alert, Badge, Progress, Skeleton
   - Navigation: Navbar, Sidebar, Breadcrumb, Pagination
   - Data: Table, List, Grid, Chart

5. **Screen Flow Mapping**:

   ```text
   FOR EACH user journey in spec.md:
   1. Map journey steps to screens
   2. For each screen:
      - Purpose: what user accomplishes
      - Entry points: how user arrives
      - Layout: structure (header, sidebar, main, footer)
      - Components used: list from Component Inventory
      - Data displayed: what information shown
      - Actions available: what user can do
      - Exit points: where user can go next
      - States: loading, empty, populated, error
   3. Generate screen flow diagram (Mermaid)
   ```

6. **Interaction Specifications**:

   ```text
   FOR EACH interactive element:
   1. Trigger: click, hover, focus, swipe, long-press
   2. Action: what happens visually
   3. Feedback: immediate response (ripple, color change)
   4. Duration: animation timing
   5. Easing: animation curve

   Common patterns:
   - Button press: scale(0.98), 100ms
   - Modal open: fade + slide, 200ms, ease-out
   - Toast appear: slide from edge, 300ms
   - Skeleton shimmer: continuous gradient animation
   - Form validation: inline error, 100ms
   ```

7. **Accessibility Audit**:

   ```text
   Validate against WCAG 2.1 level [A/AA/AAA]:

   Perceivable:
   - [ ] Color contrast ratios meet minimum (4.5:1 AA, 7:1 AAA)
   - [ ] Text can be resized to 200% without loss
   - [ ] Non-text content has text alternatives
   - [ ] Information not conveyed by color alone

   Operable:
   - [ ] All functionality keyboard accessible
   - [ ] Focus order is logical
   - [ ] Focus indicators visible
   - [ ] No keyboard traps
   - [ ] Touch targets ≥44x44px

   Understandable:
   - [ ] Language of page identified
   - [ ] Form labels and instructions clear
   - [ ] Error messages helpful and specific
   - [ ] Consistent navigation

   Robust:
   - [ ] Valid semantic HTML
   - [ ] ARIA used correctly
   - [ ] Works with assistive technologies
   ```

8. **Responsive Strategy**:

   ```text
   Define breakpoints:
   - mobile: 0-639px (touch-first)
   - tablet: 640-1023px (touch + hover)
   - desktop: 1024-1279px (mouse + keyboard)
   - wide: 1280px+ (extended layouts)

   FOR EACH component:
   - Mobile behavior: stacking, simplified, bottom sheets
   - Desktop behavior: side-by-side, expanded, modals

   FOR EACH screen:
   - Layout adaptation at each breakpoint
   - Navigation changes (hamburger ↔ full nav)
   - Content priority (what hides/shows)
   ```

9. **Write design.md** (UX Designer Agent Output):

   Use `templates/design-template.md` structure, populate with:
   - Visual Language tokens
   - Component specifications
   - Screen flows with Mermaid diagrams
   - Interaction specifications table
   - Accessibility checklist
   - Responsive breakpoint definitions
   - Traceability: link to spec.md AS and FR IDs

## Phase 2: Product Designer Agent

10. **Visual Language Refinement** (Product Designer):

    ```text
    SWITCH to persona: product-designer-agent
    READ templates/personas/product-designer-agent.md

    Input: design.md from UX Designer (Step 9)

    Tasks:
    1. Refine design tokens for production:
       - Validate color palette completeness
       - Ensure typography scale is CSS-variable-ready
       - Add missing semantic tokens

    2. Component specification depth:
       - Add variant matrix for each component
       - Specify compound variants (e.g., variant + size combinations)
       - Document component anatomy with sub-elements

    3. Design system codification:
       - Generate CSS custom properties
       - Create Tailwind config snippet (if Tailwind detected)
       - Output component API definitions

    4. Code generation preparation:
       - Mark components ready for code generation
       - Assess complexity (simple/moderate/complex)
       - Recommend v0.dev vs template generation

    Output: Updated design.md with:
    - ## Design Tokens (CSS Variables) section
    - ## Component Code Specs section
    - complexity_assessment for each component
    ```

11. **Component Code Generation** (Optional - if enabled):

    ```text
    IF orchestration.code_generation.enabled:

      FOR EACH component IN design.md WHERE ready_for_codegen:

        complexity = component.complexity_assessment

        IF complexity == "complex" OR user_prefers_v0:
          # Use v0.dev generation
          READ templates/skills/v0-generation.md
          result = v0_generation_pipeline(component.name)

        ELSE:
          # Use template-based generation
          READ templates/skills/component-codegen.md
          result = component_codegen_pipeline(component.name)

        IF result.validation.passed:
          LOG "✓ Generated {component.name}: {result.files.component}"
        ELSE:
          WARN "⚠️ {component.name} has validation issues: {result.validation.issues}"

      Output files:
      - .preview/components/{component-name}/{Component}.tsx
      - .preview/components/{component-name}/index.ts
      - .preview/components/{component-name}/{Component}.stories.tsx

    ELSE:
      LOG "ℹ️ Code generation disabled. Use /speckit.preview to generate later."
    ```

## Phase 3: Motion Designer Agent

12. **Animation System Definition** (Motion Designer):

    ```text
    SWITCH to persona: motion-designer-agent
    READ templates/personas/motion-designer-agent.md

    Input: design.md with component specs

    Tasks:
    1. Define animation tokens:
       - Duration scale (instant → dramatic)
       - Easing functions (ease-out, spring, bounce)
       - Delay patterns for staggered animations

    2. Component micro-interactions:
       - Button press feedback
       - Form field focus transitions
       - Loading state animations
       - Success/error feedback

    3. Page transitions:
       - Screen-to-screen transitions
       - Modal/drawer entry/exit
       - Toast notifications

    4. Reduced motion alternatives:
       - prefers-reduced-motion variants
       - Static fallbacks for all animations

    5. Generate animation code:
       READ templates/skills/motion-generation.md
       result = motion_generation_pipeline()

    Output: Updated design.md with:
    - ## Motion System section
    - Animation token definitions
    - Component animation specs
    - Reduced motion alternatives

    Generated files:
    - .preview/animations/tokens.css
    - .preview/animations/framer-variants.ts
    - .preview/animations/tailwind-keyframes.js
    ```

13. **Load Animation Presets** (if applicable):

    ```text
    IF constitution.design_system.motion.presets:

      FOR EACH preset IN motion.presets:
        READ templates/shared/animation-presets/{preset}.md

        MERGE preset animations into design.md Motion System:
        - Add preset tokens to duration/easing scales
        - Add preset component animations
        - Include preset reduced-motion alternatives

      LOG "✓ Loaded animation presets: {presets}"
    ```

---

## Phase 4: Quality Validation

14. **Design Quality Score (DQS) Calculation**:

    ```text
    DQS = Design Quality Score (0-100)

    READ templates/shared/quality/dqs-rubric.md for full rubric.

    CALCULATE scores using 25-checkpoint rubric:

    # Visual Hierarchy (25 points)
    vh_score = SUM(VH-01 to VH-05)  # Clear CTAs, headings, whitespace, balance, scanning

    # Consistency (20 points)
    cn_score = SUM(CN-01 to CN-05)  # Token usage, component reuse, naming, patterns, icons

    # Accessibility (25 points)
    ac_score = SUM(AC-01 to AC-05)  # Contrast, touch targets, focus, screen reader, motion

    # Responsiveness (15 points)
    rs_score = SUM(RS-01 to RS-05)  # Breakpoints, layout, touch/pointer, priority, images

    # Interaction Design (15 points)
    id_score = SUM(ID-01 to ID-05)  # States, timing, loading, errors, success

    DQS = vh_score + cn_score + ac_score + rs_score + id_score

    # Quality Gates (from memory/domains/quality-gates.md)
    QG-DQS-001: DQS >= 70 (Ready for implementation)
    QG-DQS-002: ac_score >= 15 (60% accessibility minimum)
    QG-DQS-003: AC-01 = 5 (WCAG AA contrast compliance)

    # Interpret score
    IF DQS >= 70:
      STATUS = "✓ Ready for Implementation"
    ELIF DQS >= 50:
      STATUS = "⚠️ Needs Improvement"
      TRIGGER iteration
    ELSE:
      STATUS = "✗ Major Rework Required"
      BLOCK implementation
    ```

    **A11y Validation**: Reference `templates/shared/a11y/wcag-21-aa-requirements.md` for detailed WCAG checklist.

15. **DQS Report Generation**:

    ```text
    OUTPUT:
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Design Quality Score (DQS)                                   │

## Validation Gates

Before completing, verify:

- [ ] All color tokens have contrast ratios documented
- [ ] Typography scale has mobile and desktop values
- [ ] Each component has all states defined
- [ ] Each component has accessibility requirements
- [ ] Screen flows match user journeys from spec.md
- [ ] Interaction specifications have timing values
- [ ] Accessibility checklist is complete for target level
- [ ] Responsive behavior documented for all breakpoints
- [ ] Design tokens are CSS-variable-ready names

## Quality Guidelines

### Component Specification Depth

**Too shallow** (missing critical info):
```markdown
### Button
- Click to submit
```

**Good** (actionable for developers):
```markdown
### Button
**States**: default, hover, active, focus, disabled, loading
**Variants**:
- Size: sm (32px), md (40px), lg (48px)
- Style: primary, secondary, ghost, destructive
**Accessibility**:
- Role: button
- Keyboard: Enter/Space to activate
- Focus: 2px ring, offset 2px
- Disabled: aria-disabled, no pointer events
**Loading state**: spinner replaces text, min-width preserved
```

### Screen Flow Clarity

**Vague**:
```markdown
User goes to settings and changes things
```

**Clear**:
```markdown
### Settings Screen
**Entry**: Header menu → Settings icon, or /settings URL
**Layout**: Sidebar (categories) + Main (form sections)
**Components**: Tabs, Toggle, Input, Button
**Actions**:
- Toggle notification preferences → immediate save, toast feedback
- Change password → modal with current/new/confirm fields
**Exit**: Back button → previous page, or nav to other section
```

### Accessibility Specificity

**Vague**:
```markdown
Make it accessible
```

**Specific**:
```markdown
**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**:
- Primary button (#2563EB on #FFF): 4.54:1 ✓
- Body text (#374151 on #FFF): 7.21:1 ✓
- Error text (#DC2626 on #FFF): 4.53:1 ✓
- Focus ring: 2px solid #2563EB, offset 2px
- Skip link: hidden until focused, appears top-left
- Form errors: aria-invalid + aria-describedby to error text
```

## Output

## Design Writing Quality Rules

**Quality Imports**:
```text
IMPORT: templates/shared/quality/anti-slop.md
```

### Design-Specific Forbidden Phrases

Beyond the general anti-slop rules, avoid these design clichés:

```text
FORBIDDEN_DESIGN_PHRASES = [
  # Generic descriptions
  "modern look and feel",
  "clean aesthetic",
  "user-friendly interface",
  "intuitive design",
  "sleek and professional",
  "visually appealing",
  "seamless experience",
  "elegant solution",

  # Vague color descriptions
  "nice color palette",
  "good contrast",
  "pleasant colors",

  # Non-specific UX claims
  "improved usability",
  "better user experience",
  "enhanced accessibility"
]
```

### Design Writing Rules

```text
DESIGN_QUALITY_RULES = [
  # Specificity
  "Name actual colors: '#3B82F6 (Blue 500)' not 'a nice blue'",
  "Specify exact values: '16px' not 'appropriate spacing'",
  "Reference tokens: 'color.primary.500' not 'the primary color'",

  # Boldness
  "Commit to an aesthetic direction: 'Brutalist typography' not 'modern fonts'",
  "Make opinionated choices: 'Sharp 2px corners' not 'subtle rounding'",
  "Take a stance: 'Bold 700 weight for CTAs' not 'prominent buttons'",

  # Rationale
  "Explain WHY, not just WHAT: 'Large touch targets (48px) for mobile users with motor impairments'",
  "Connect to user needs: 'High contrast (7:1) for outdoor visibility'",
  "Reference principles: 'Following Gestalt proximity for form grouping'"
]
```

### Pre-Generation Check

Before generating design artifacts, verify:

```text
DESIGN_QUALITY_GATE:
  1. All colors use HEX or design tokens (no "blue", "red" without values)
  2. All spacing uses explicit values (no "some padding", "good margin")
  3. All typography specifies weight, size, line-height (no "larger text")
  4. All rationale explains user benefit (no "looks better")
  5. All accessibility claims include WCAG level and technique
```

---

## Self-Review Phase (MANDATORY)

**Before declaring design.md complete, you MUST perform self-review.**

This ensures visual specifications are complete, accessible, and ready for implementation.

### Step 1: Re-read Generated Artifact

Read the design file you created:
- `specs/[NNN-feature]/design.md`

### Step 2: Quality Criteria

| ID | Criterion | Check | Severity |
|----|-----------|-------|----------|
| SR-DESIGN-01 | Color Tokens Defined | All semantic colors have values | CRITICAL |
| SR-DESIGN-02 | Contrast Ratios Valid | All text colors meet WCAG minimums (≥4.5:1) | CRITICAL |
| SR-DESIGN-03 | Typography Scale Complete | All heading levels + body defined | HIGH |
| SR-DESIGN-04 | Component States Listed | Each component has all states (default, hover, etc.) | HIGH |
| SR-DESIGN-05 | Accessibility Documented | ARIA roles, keyboard nav for each component | HIGH |
| SR-DESIGN-06 | Screen Flows Mapped | All user journeys have screen sequences | HIGH |
| SR-DESIGN-07 | Responsive Defined | Breakpoints and behavior documented | MEDIUM |
| SR-DESIGN-08 | Interactions Specified | Animation timing/easing documented | MEDIUM |
| SR-DESIGN-09 | Traceability Present | Components linked to FR/AS from spec.md | MEDIUM |
| SR-DESIGN-10 | Accessibility Checklist | WCAG checklist completed for target level | HIGH |

**Game Art Pipeline Mode Additional Criteria** (if `MODE == game_art_pipeline`):

| ID | Criterion | Check | Severity |
|----|-----------|-------|----------|
| SR-ART-01 | AQS Calculation Complete | AQS worksheet filled out with all 6 dimensions scored | CRITICAL |
| SR-ART-02 | Asset Catalog Minimum | Asset catalog has ≥200 items with unique IDs | CRITICAL |
| SR-ART-03 | Audio Latency Documented | Audio requirements specify <50ms latency (UI <20ms, Gameplay <30ms) | CRITICAL |
| SR-ART-04 | Material Sound Library | Audio includes 8+ materials with 4 sounds each, ASMR rating ≥4 | HIGH |
| SR-ART-05 | VFX Performance Budget | VFX specs enforce ≤150 particles on-screen with culling strategy | HIGH |
| SR-ART-06 | Visual Style Complete | Art spec has mood board (3-5 refs) + color palette + typography system | HIGH |
| SR-ART-07 | Animation State Machines | Animation library includes player/enemy FSM with ASCII diagrams | HIGH |
| SR-ART-08 | Performance Budgets | Technical constraints documented: 256MB textures, 64MB audio | CRITICAL |
| SR-ART-09 | Frame Rate Standards | Animation frame rates specified: UI 60fps, Gameplay 30fps, Background 15-20fps | MEDIUM |
| SR-ART-10 | Quality Checklists | All 4 output files have validation checklists completed | MEDIUM |

### Step 3: Accessibility Validation

Verify contrast ratios for all color tokens:

```text
FOR EACH text color token:
  Calculate contrast ratio against background
  IF ratio < 4.5:1 (AA) OR < 7:1 (AAA if target):
    ERROR: "Color {token} fails contrast: {ratio}:1 (min {required}:1)"

FOR EACH interactive element:
  Verify focus indicator is defined
  Verify keyboard interaction is documented
  Verify touch target ≥ 44px (if mobile)
```

### Step 4: Component Completeness

For each component in inventory, verify:

```text
FOR EACH component:
  Required states = [default, hover, active, focus, disabled]
  IF component is form element:
    Required states += [error, success, loading]

  FOR EACH required_state:
    IF state not documented:
      WARN: "Component {name} missing state: {state}"

  IF no ARIA role defined:
    ERROR: "Component {name} missing accessibility role"

  IF no keyboard interaction defined:
    ERROR: "Component {name} missing keyboard interaction"
```

### Step 5: Verdict

- **PASS**: All CRITICAL/HIGH criteria pass, accessibility validated → proceed to handoff
- **FAIL**: Any CRITICAL issue (contrast, missing components) → self-correct (max 3 iterations)
- **WARN**: Only MEDIUM issues → show warnings, proceed

### Step 6: Self-Correction Loop

```text
IF issues found AND iteration < 3:
  1. Fix each issue:
     - Adjust colors to meet contrast ratios
     - Add missing component states
     - Document keyboard interactions
     - Complete accessibility checklist
  2. Re-run self-review from Step 1
  3. Report: "Self-review iteration {N}: Fixed {issues}, re-validating..."

IF still failing after 3 iterations:
  - STOP and report to user
  - List accessibility compliance gaps
  - Do NOT proceed to handoff
```

### Step 7: Self-Review Report

After passing self-review, output:

```text
## Self-Review Complete ✓

**Artifact**: specs/[NNN-feature]/design.md
**Iterations**: {N}

### Validation Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Color Tokens | ✓ {N} defined |
| Contrast Ratios | ✓ All ≥ {min}:1 |
| Typography | ✓ Complete scale |
| Components | ✓ {N} specified with states |
| Accessibility | ✓ WCAG {level} compliant |
| Screen Flows | ✓ {N} screens mapped |

### Accessibility Summary

|-------|------------|----------|--------|
| text-primary | white | 7.2:1 | ✓ AA |
| text-secondary | white | 5.1:1 | ✓ AA |
| error | white | 4.6:1 | ✓ AA |

### Component Coverage

| Component | States | A11y | Responsive |
|-----------|--------|------|------------|
| {name} | ✓ 6/6 | ✓ | ✓ |
