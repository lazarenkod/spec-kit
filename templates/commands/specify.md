## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Brownfield Detection

**Automatically detect if this is a brownfield project**:

```text
1. Check codebase indicators:
   - git log --oneline | wc -l > 50 commits → BROWNFIELD_SIGNAL
   - src/ OR backend/ OR frontend/ directory exists with .py/.ts/.js/.go files → BROWNFIELD_SIGNAL
   - package.json OR requirements.txt OR go.mod exists → BROWNFIELD_SIGNAL

2. Check user input keywords:
   - Contains: "existing", "modify", "extend", "refactor", "migrate", "upgrade", "fix", "improve"
   - Contains: "current system", "legacy", "brownfield", "existing code", "already have"
   → BROWNFIELD_SIGNAL

3. Check for baseline.md:
   - IF FEATURE_DIR/baseline.md exists → BROWNFIELD_CONFIRMED
   - This file is generated by /speckit.baseline command

4. Determine mode:
   - IF BROWNFIELD_SIGNAL count >= 2 OR BROWNFIELD_CONFIRMED:
     - Set BROWNFIELD_MODE = true
     - Include "Change Specification" section in spec.md
   - ELSE:
     - Set BROWNFIELD_MODE = false
     - Skip "Change Specification" section entirely
```

**When BROWNFIELD_MODE = true**:

1. If baseline.md exists, parse it to auto-populate:

---

## Workspace Detection

**Automatically detect if this feature is part of a multi-repository workspace**:

```text
1. Check for workspace marker (traverse up from current directory):
   - IF .speckit-workspace file exists:
     WORKSPACE_MODE = true
     WORKSPACE_ROOT = directory containing .speckit-workspace
     WORKSPACE_CONFIG = parse YAML from .speckit-workspace

2. If WORKSPACE_MODE = true:
   - Extract current repository alias from workspace config
   - Load list of related repositories
   - Set CURRENT_REPO_ALIAS for cross-repo references

3. Determine workspace context:
   - CURRENT_REPO_ALIAS = repository alias for this feature
   - AVAILABLE_REPOS = list of all repos in workspace
   - CROSS_DEPENDENCIES = existing cross-repo dependencies from workspace config
```

**When WORKSPACE_MODE = true**:

1. Include "Cross-Repository Dependencies" section in spec.md
2. Suggest potential cross-repo dependencies based on:
   - Repository roles (e.g., frontend depends on backend API)
   - Existing patterns in workspace cross_dependencies
3. Use format: `repo-alias:feature-id` for all cross-repo references

**When WORKSPACE_MODE = false** (single-repo project):

1. Skip the "Cross-Repository Dependencies" section entirely
2. All feature references are local (just feature-id, no repo prefix)

---

**When BROWNFIELD_MODE = true**:
   - Current State Analysis (CB-xxx entries from baseline components)
   - Current Limitations (infer from user description)
   - Initial Change Delta (infer ADD/MODIFY/REMOVE from user intent)

2. If baseline.md does NOT exist, suggest:
   ```text
   💡 Brownfield project detected. Consider running `/speckit.baseline` first
   to capture current system state for better change traceability.

   Proceed without baseline? (Y/N)
   ```

3. Generate appropriate Change Type from user input:
   - "add feature" → Enhancement
   - "refactor" → Refactor
   - "migrate from X to Y" → Migration
   - "fix bug" → Bugfix
   - "optimize", "performance" → Performance
   - "security", "vulnerability" → Security

---

## Concept Integration

**Check for existing concept document**:

1. Look for `specs/concept.md` in the repository root
2. If concept.md exists:
   - Parse the Feature Hierarchy section to find matching Concept IDs
   - The user input may reference Concept IDs directly (e.g., "EPIC-001.F01.S01")
   - Or the user may describe a feature that matches stories in the concept
   - Extract: Vision context, related User Journeys, Dependencies
   - Set `CONCEPT_REFERENCE` to the matched Concept ID(s)
   - Use the concept's priority levels (P1a, P1b) for User Story prioritization

3. If concept.md does NOT exist:
   - Proceed with standalone specification
   - Set `CONCEPT_REFERENCE` to "N/A"
   - Use simple priorities (P1, P2, P3) or sub-priorities as needed

**Concept ID Matching Logic**:

```text
IF user input contains pattern "EPIC-\d+\.F\d+\.S\d+":
  CONCEPT_IDS = extract all matching IDs
  Validate each ID exists in concept.md
ELSE:
  Search concept.md Feature Hierarchy for:
    - Story descriptions that match user input keywords
    - Feature names that match user input
  CONCEPT_IDS = matched story IDs (or "N/A" if no match)
```

## Incomplete Feature Check

Before creating a new feature, check for incomplete work in the feature manifest:

```text
MANIFEST_FILE = specs/features/.manifest.md

IF exists(MANIFEST_FILE):
  Parse manifest table
  Find features with status NOT IN [MERGED, ABANDONED]

  IF incomplete_features.count > 0:
    Display warning:

    ⚠️ **Incomplete Features Detected**

    | ID | Name | Status | Last Updated |
    |----|------|--------|--------------|
    | [list each incomplete feature] |

    **Options**:
    1. **Resume existing**: Run `/speckit.switch <ID>` to continue working on an existing feature
    2. **Start new anyway**: Confirm to proceed with creating a new feature
    3. **Abandon old**: Mark incomplete features as ABANDONED first

    **Note**: Proceeding will create a new feature. Incomplete feature(s) above
    will remain accessible via `/speckit.switch`.

    ASK user: "Do you want to proceed with creating a new feature? (yes/no)"

    IF user confirms:
      CONTINUE to branch creation
    ELSE:
      EXIT with suggestion to use /speckit.switch

ELSE:
  # No manifest exists - this is the first feature
  CONTINUE to branch creation
```

---

## Extension Detection

**Detect if user intent suggests extending an existing feature**:

```text
MERGED_FEATURES = get features from manifest where Status = MERGED

IF MERGED_FEATURES.count > 0:
  Analyze user input for extension patterns:

  PATTERN_KEYWORDS = ["add to", "extend", "enhance", "improve", "update", "modify",
                      "fix in", "change", "refactor", "upgrade", "add feature to"]

  FEATURE_REFERENCES = look for:
    - Direct feature IDs: "001", "feature 001", "#001"
    - Feature names: "login", "auth", "payment"
    - System spec references: "login system", "auth module"

  IF user input matches PATTERN_KEYWORDS AND references existing feature:
    EXTENSION_CANDIDATE = find matching merged feature

    Display suggestion:

    💡 **Extension Opportunity Detected**

    Your description suggests modifying the **{EXTENSION_CANDIDATE}** feature
    which was merged on {MERGE_DATE}.

    **Recommendation**: Use `/speckit.extend` instead to:
    - ✅ Preserve Feature Lineage (traceability)
    - ✅ Auto-load parent context
    - ✅ Track System Spec evolution correctly

    **Example**:
    ```
    /speckit.extend {EXTENSION_CANDIDATE_ID} "{USER_DESCRIPTION}"
    ```

    **Options**:
    1. **Use /speckit.extend** (Recommended) - Creates extension with lineage
    2. **Create standalone feature** - Proceed without lineage (loses traceability)

    ASK user: "Would you like to use /speckit.extend instead? (yes/no)"

    IF user says yes:
      Redirect to: /speckit.extend {EXTENSION_CANDIDATE_ID} "{USER_DESCRIPTION}"
      EXIT
    ELSE:
      CONTINUE to branch creation
      Note: Feature will not have Feature Lineage section populated
```

**Relationship Type Detection**:

```text
Based on description keywords, suggest relationship if extending:

"add", "new", "implement", "support", "enable" → EXTENDS
"improve", "enhance", "optimize", "refactor", "clean" → REFINES
"fix", "bug", "issue", "correct", "patch", "resolve" → FIXES
"replace", "remove", "deprecate", "migrate", "sunset" → DEPRECATES
```

---

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `{ARGS}` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that feature description, do this:

0. **Load project language setting**:

   Read `/memory/constitution.md` and extract the `language` value from the Project Settings table.

   ```text
   IF Project Settings section exists AND language row found:
     ARTIFACT_LANGUAGE = extracted value (e.g., "ru", "en", "de")
   ELSE:
     ARTIFACT_LANGUAGE = "en" (default)

   Apply language rules from templates/shared/language-context.md:
   - Generate all prose content in ARTIFACT_LANGUAGE
   - Keep IDs (FR-001, AS-001), technical terms (API, JWT), and code in English
   ```

   Report: "Generating specification in {LANGUAGE_NAME} ({ARTIFACT_LANGUAGE})..."

1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:
   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords
   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature
   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., "add-user-auth", "fix-payment-bug")
   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)
   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance
   - Examples:
     - "I want to add user authentication" → "user-auth"
     - "Implement OAuth2 integration for the API" → "oauth2-api-integration"
     - "Create a dashboard for analytics" → "analytics-dashboard"
     - "Fix payment processing timeout bug" → "fix-payment-timeout"

2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:

   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:

      ```bash
      git fetch --all --prune
      ```

   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:
      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`

   c. Determine the next available number:
      - Extract all numbers from all three sources
      - Find the highest number N
      - Use N+1 for the new branch number

   d. Run the script `{SCRIPT}` with the calculated number and short-name:
      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name "your-short-name"` along with the feature description
      - Bash example: `{SCRIPT} --json --number 5 --short-name "user-auth" "Add user authentication"`
      - PowerShell example: `{SCRIPT} -Json -Number 5 -ShortName "user-auth" "Add user authentication"`

   **IMPORTANT**:
   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number
   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern
   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1
   - You must only ever run this script once per feature
   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for
   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot")

3. Load `templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.

4. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user description from Input
       If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"

    2. Extract key concepts from description
       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints

    3. Check Concept Integration (see section above)
       - If concept.md exists: extract CONCEPT_REFERENCE and related context
       - Use concept priorities (P1a, P1b) and dependencies

    4. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience
         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details

    5. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section with **sub-priorities**:
       - If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
       - Assign priorities using sub-levels: P1a, P1b, P1c (MVP critical path), P2a, P2b (post-MVP)
       - Add **Concept Reference** per User Story linking to CONCEPT_IDS
       - Add **Independent Test** description for each story

    6. Generate **Acceptance Scenarios with IDs** in tabular format:

       **ID Format**: `AS-[story number][scenario letter]`
       - Story 1 scenarios: AS-1A, AS-1B, AS-1C
       - Story 2 scenarios: AS-2A, AS-2B
       - Edge cases: EC-001, EC-002

       **Table Structure**:
       ```markdown
       | ID | Given | When | Then |
       |----|-------|------|------|
       | AS-1A | [initial state] | [action] | [expected outcome] |
       ```

       **IMPORTANT**: These IDs will be referenced in tasks.md for traceability:
       - Test tasks will use [TEST:AS-1A] markers
       - This enables end-to-end traceability: Concept → Spec → Tasks → Tests

    7. Generate Functional Requirements with IDs (FR-001, FR-002)
       - Each requirement must be testable
       - Link each FR to relevant Acceptance Scenarios: `*Acceptance Scenarios*: AS-1A, AS-1B`
       - Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions)

    8. Define Success Criteria (SC-001, SC-002)
       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures
       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details

    9. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)

    10. Generate Traceability Summary table:
        ```markdown
        | Requirement | Acceptance Scenarios | Edge Cases | Status |
        |-------------|---------------------|------------|--------|
        | FR-001 | AS-1A, AS-1B | EC-001 | Defined |
        ```

    11. **IF WORKSPACE_MODE = true**: Generate Cross-Repository Dependencies section:

        a) Identify the current repository alias from workspace config

        b) Analyze feature requirements for cross-repo dependencies:
           - API calls to other services → REQUIRES dependency
           - Shared data models or events → USES dependency
           - Feature extending another repo's capability → EXTENDS dependency
           - Feature implementing a contract from another repo → IMPLEMENTS dependency

        c) Populate "Dependencies on Other Repositories" table:
           ```markdown
           | This Feature | Depends On | Dependency Type | Reason |
           |--------------|------------|-----------------|--------|
           | {CURRENT_REPO}:{FEATURE_ID} | api:002-payment-api | REQUIRES | Needs payment processing |
           ```

        d) Identify potential reverse dependencies:
           - If this feature exposes an API, which repos might consume it?
           - If this feature publishes events, which repos might subscribe?

        e) Suggest cross-repo dependencies based on repository roles:
           - Frontend repos typically REQUIRES backend APIs
           - Mobile repos often USES same APIs as web frontend
           - Shared libraries are typically USED BY multiple consumers

        f) IF no cross-repo dependencies identified:
           - Remove the Cross-Repository Dependencies section from spec
           - Note: "No cross-repository dependencies detected"

    12. **IF BROWNFIELD_MODE = true**: Generate Change Specification section:

        a) Parse baseline.md (if exists) to extract:
           - Component inventory → CB-xxx entries
           - Current behavior descriptions
           - Code locations (file:line references)

        b) Analyze user description to infer:
           - Current Limitations (CL-xxx) from problem statements
           - Change Delta (CHG-xxx) from desired outcomes
           - Preserved Behaviors (PB-xxx) from "keep existing" / "maintain compatibility" phrases

        c) Generate Change Type from keywords:
           ```text
           IF "migrate" OR "move from" OR "upgrade" → Migration
           ELIF "refactor" OR "restructure" → Refactor
           ELIF "fix" OR "bug" OR "issue" → Bugfix
           ELIF "optimize" OR "performance" OR "speed" → Performance
           ELIF "security" OR "vulnerability" OR "CVE" → Security
           ELSE → Enhancement
           ```

        d) Map changes to requirements:
           - Link each CHG-xxx to relevant FR-xxx
           - Ensure every CL-xxx has at least one CHG-xxx addressing it

        e) IF Change Type = Migration:
           - Generate Migration Plan section
           - Suggest migration strategy based on scope
           - Create placeholder deprecation timeline

        f) Generate Rollback Criteria:
           - Add default metrics: error rate, response time
           - Suggest custom metrics based on feature type

    13. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

5b. **Update Concept Traceability** (if concept.md exists):

   This step ensures the concept document stays in sync with specification progress.

   ```text
   IF exists("specs/concept.md"):
     1. Read concept.md
     2. Find "Traceability Skeleton" section

     3. FOR EACH concept_id in CONCEPT_IDS:
        FIND row WHERE "Concept ID" == concept_id
        UPDATE row:
          - "Spec Created": [x]
          - "Requirements": comma-separated list of FR-xxx IDs from spec.md
          - "Status": "SPECIFIED"

     4. Update "Progress Rollup" section:
        - Decrement "Not started" count
        - Increment "SPECIFIED" count
        - Recalculate percentages

     5. Update "Foundation Progress" section (if applicable):
        FOR EACH concept_id:
          IF concept_id.wave == 1 OR wave == 2:
            Update wave progress counts

     6. Set "Last Updated" field:
        - "[date] by /speckit.specify"

     7. Write updated concept.md

   Report: "Concept traceability updated: {CONCEPT_IDS} → SPECIFIED"
   ```

   **Example update**:
   ```markdown
   ## Traceability Skeleton

   | Concept ID | Wave | Spec Created | Requirements | Tasks | Tests | Status |
   |------------|------|--------------|--------------|-------|-------|--------|
   | EPIC-001.F01.S01 | 1 | [x] | FR-001, FR-002, FR-003 | - | - | SPECIFIED |
   | EPIC-001.F01.S02 | 1 | [x] | FR-004, FR-005 | - | - | SPECIFIED |
   | EPIC-001.F02.S01 | 1 | [ ] | - | - | - | Not started |

   ### Progress Rollup

   | Status | Count | % |
   |--------|-------|---|
   | Not started | 1 | 33% |
   | SPECIFIED | 2 | 67% |
   | TASKED | 0 | 0% |
   | ...

   **Last Updated**: 2025-12-27 by /speckit.specify
   ```

6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:

      ```markdown
      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]
      
      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]
      
      ## Content Quality
      
      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed
      
      ## Requirement Completeness
      
      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable
      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
      - [ ] Edge cases are identified
      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified
      
      ## Feature Readiness
      
      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification
      
      ## Notes
      
      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results**:

      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6

      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the spec to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user

      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]
           
           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]

           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

7. Report completion with:
   - Branch name and spec file path
   - Checklist results
   - **Traceability summary**:
     - Concept Reference: [CONCEPT_IDS or "Standalone spec"]
     - Acceptance Scenarios created: N (AS-1A to AS-Nx)
     - Functional Requirements: N (FR-001 to FR-00N)
     - Edge Cases: N (EC-001 to EC-00N)

     - Preserved Behaviors: N (PB-001 to PB-00N)
     - Migration Phases: N (if applicable)
     - Baseline used: [Yes - baseline.md | No - manual entry]
   - **Workspace summary** (if WORKSPACE_MODE = true):
     - Workspace: [workspace name]
     - Current Repository: [repo-alias]
     - Cross-Repository Dependencies: N
       - REQUIRES: N
       - EXTENDS: N
       - USES: N
     - Features Depending on This: N (if identified)
   - Readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`)

**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.

## Concept-to-Spec Workflow

When `specs/concept.md` exists, follow this enhanced workflow:

```text
1. User runs: /speckit.specify EPIC-001.F01.S01, EPIC-001.F01.S02

2. Agent reads concept.md and extracts:
   - Stories: EPIC-001.F01.S01, EPIC-001.F01.S02
   - Parent Feature: EPIC-001.F01 (description, priority, dependencies)
   - Parent Epic: EPIC-001 (goal, context)
   - Related User Journeys (J001, J002 that reference these features)
   - Dependencies from Cross-Feature Dependencies matrix

3. Agent creates spec.md with:
   - **Source Concept**: specs/concept.md
   - **Concept IDs Covered**: EPIC-001.F01.S01, EPIC-001.F01.S02
   - User Stories populated from concept story descriptions
   - Priorities inherited from concept (P1a, P1b)
   - Acceptance Scenarios generated with IDs (AS-1A, AS-1B)

4. Agent updates concept.md Traceability Skeleton:
   | Concept ID | Spec Created | Spec Requirements | Status |
   |------------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
   | EPIC-001.F01.S01 | [x] | FR-001, FR-002 | Specified |
   | EPIC-001.F01.S02 | [x] | FR-003 | Specified |
```

**Benefits**:
- No idea loss: all concept stories are tracked
- Priorities flow from concept to spec
- Dependencies are visible across specs
- Full traceability from Vision → Spec → Tasks → Tests

## General Guidelines

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.
- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience
   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications
   - Lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)
   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)
   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):

- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain
- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified
- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks
- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps
- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise

### Success Criteria Guidelines

Success criteria must be:

1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)
2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools
3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals
4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details

**Good examples**:

- "Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes"
- "System supports 10,000 concurrent users"
- "95% of searches return results in under 1 second"
- "Task completion rate improves by 40%"

**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):

- "API response time is under 200ms" (too technical, use "Users see results instantly")
- "Database can handle 1000 TPS" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)
- "React components render efficiently" (framework-specific)
- "Redis cache hit rate above 80%" (technology-specific)

## Automation Behavior

When this command completes successfully, the following automation rules apply:

### Auto-Transitions

| Condition | Next Phase | Gate |
|-----------|------------|------|
| spec.md valid, no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] | `/speckit.plan` | Spec Quality Gate |

### Quality Gates

| Gate | Check | Block Condition | Message |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------|
| Spec Quality Gate | All checklists/requirements.md items pass | Incomplete items > 0 | "Resolve incomplete checklist items before proceeding" |

### Gate Behavior

**If all conditions pass and no gates block:**
- Automatically proceed to `/speckit.plan` with the created specification
- Log transition for audit trail

**If gates block:**
- Display blocking message to user
- List incomplete checklist items
- Wait for user to resolve issues
- Offer handoff options for manual intervention

### Manual Overrides

Users can always choose to:
- Skip automation by selecting a different handoff option
- Force proceed (with acknowledgment of incomplete items)
- Run `/speckit.clarify` to address [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers first

## Self-Review Phase (MANDATORY)

**Before declaring the specification complete, you MUST perform self-review.**

This phase ensures specification quality and catches issues before handoff to planning.

### Step 1: Re-read Your Output

Read the spec.md file you just created:
1. Open `FEATURE_DIR/spec.md`
2. Read through all sections completely
3. Check for consistency and completeness

### Step 2: Quality Criteria

Answer each question by examining the specification:

| ID | Question | Severity |
|----|----------|----------|
| SR-SPEC-01 | All mandatory sections filled (Overview, User Stories, FR, AS, SC)? | CRITICAL |
| SR-SPEC-02 | No implementation details (frameworks, APIs, databases, languages)? | HIGH |
| SR-SPEC-03 | Each FR has at least one linked AS? | HIGH |
| SR-SPEC-04 | All AS follow Given/When/Then format? | MEDIUM |
| SR-SPEC-05 | No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3 critical ones)? | MEDIUM |
| SR-SPEC-06 | Success Criteria are measurable with specific metrics? | HIGH |
| SR-SPEC-07 | Success Criteria are technology-agnostic? | HIGH |
| SR-SPEC-08 | User Stories have clear acceptance scenarios? | MEDIUM |
| SR-SPEC-09 | Edge cases (EC-xxx) identified for error scenarios? | MEDIUM |
| SR-SPEC-10 | Traceability Summary table complete and accurate? | LOW |

**UXQ Domain Criteria** *(apply when UXQ domain is active)*:

Check if `memory/constitution.domain.md` references UXQ domain. If yes, also validate:

| ID | Question | Severity |
|----|----------|----------|
| SR-UXQ-01 | Jobs to Be Done documented with proper format (When/Want/So)? | HIGH |
| SR-UXQ-02 | Each FR traces to at least one JTBD? | HIGH |
| SR-UXQ-03 | User Mental Model section describes user expectations? | MEDIUM |
| SR-UXQ-04 | FTUE section documents first-time user flow separately? | HIGH |
| SR-UXQ-05 | All friction points have type AND justification? | HIGH |
| SR-UXQ-06 | No unjustified friction remains in the list? | CRITICAL |
| SR-UXQ-07 | Delight opportunities identified for success states? | LOW |
| SR-UXQ-08 | Emotional journey maps key steps with design responses? | MEDIUM |
| SR-UXQ-09 | Accessibility framed as empowerment (not just compliance)? | HIGH |
| SR-UXQ-10 | Error messages documented from user perspective (UXQ-005)? | HIGH |

**Workspace Criteria** *(apply when WORKSPACE_MODE = true)*:

Check if `.speckit-workspace` exists in parent directories. If yes, also validate:

| ID | Question | Severity |
|----|----------|----------|
| SR-WS-01 | Cross-Repository Dependencies section present (if dependencies exist)? | MEDIUM |
| SR-WS-02 | All cross-repo references use valid `repo-alias:feature-id` format? | HIGH |
| SR-WS-03 | Referenced repository aliases exist in workspace config? | HIGH |
| SR-WS-04 | Dependency types are valid (REQUIRES, BLOCKS, EXTENDS, IMPLEMENTS, USES)? | MEDIUM |
| SR-WS-05 | No self-referential dependencies (feature depending on itself)? | HIGH |

**Evaluation format**:
```text
🔍 Self-Review: Specification Quality
├── SR-SPEC-01: ✅ PASS - All 5 mandatory sections present
├── SR-SPEC-02: ⚠️ HIGH - Found "PostgreSQL" in FR-003
├── SR-SPEC-03: ✅ PASS - 8/8 FRs linked to AS
├── SR-SPEC-04: ✅ PASS - All AS use Given/When/Then
├── SR-SPEC-05: ✅ PASS - 0 unresolved markers
├── SR-SPEC-06: ✅ PASS - All SC have metrics
├── SR-SPEC-07: ⚠️ HIGH - SC-002 mentions "API response time"
├── SR-SPEC-08: ✅ PASS - All stories have AS
├── SR-SPEC-09: ✅ PASS - 4 edge cases defined
└── SR-SPEC-10: ✅ PASS - Traceability table complete

Summary: CRITICAL=0, HIGH=2, MEDIUM=0, LOW=0
```

### Step 3: Verdict

Determine the self-review verdict:

| Verdict | Condition | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **PASS** | CRITICAL=0 AND HIGH=0 | Proceed to /speckit.plan handoff |
| **WARN** | CRITICAL=0 AND HIGH≤2 | Show warnings, proceed with caution |
| **FAIL** | CRITICAL>0 OR HIGH>2 | Self-correct, re-check |

### Step 4: Self-Correction Loop

**IF verdict is FAIL AND iteration < 3**:
1. Fix each CRITICAL and HIGH issue:
   - Remove implementation details (replace with technology-agnostic language)
   - Add missing FR→AS links
   - Rewrite SC to remove technical metrics
   - Resolve or reduce [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
2. Re-run self-review from Step 1
3. Increment iteration counter
4. Report: `Self-Review Iteration 2/3...`

**Common fixes**:
| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "PostgreSQL" in FR | Replace with "persistent data storage" |
| "API response < 200ms" | Replace with "Users see results instantly" |
| Missing AS link | Add `*Acceptance Scenarios*: AS-xxx` to FR |
| Vague SC | Add specific metric: "completion rate", "time", "error rate" |

**IF still FAIL after 3 iterations**:
```text
❌ Self-Review FAILED after 3 iterations

Remaining issues:
- SR-SPEC-02: Implementation detail in FR-003 ("uses WebSocket")
- SR-SPEC-07: SC-002 still mentions "API latency"

⛔ BLOCKING: Cannot proceed to planning.
   Fix remaining issues or override with user confirmation.

User: Proceed anyway? (yes/no)
```

**IF verdict is PASS or WARN**:
```text
✅ Self-Review PASSED

Summary:
- Quality Criteria: 10/10 passing
- Iterations: 1
- Traceability: 8 FRs → 12 AS → 4 EC

→ Proceeding to handoff: /speckit.plan
```

### Self-Review Report Template

Generate this report before handoff:

```markdown
## Self-Review Report

**Command**: /speckit.specify
**Artifact**: spec.md
**Reviewed at**: {{TIMESTAMP}}
**Iteration**: {{N}}/3

### Quality Criteria
| ID | Question | Status |
|----|----------|--------|
| SR-SPEC-01 | All mandatory sections? | ✅ PASS |
| SR-SPEC-02 | No implementation details? | ✅ PASS |
| SR-SPEC-03 | FR→AS links complete? | ✅ PASS |
| SR-SPEC-04 | AS format correct? | ✅ PASS |
| SR-SPEC-05 | Clarifications resolved? | ✅ PASS |
| SR-SPEC-06 | SC measurable? | ✅ PASS |
| SR-SPEC-07 | SC tech-agnostic? | ✅ PASS |
| SR-SPEC-08 | Stories have AS? | ✅ PASS |
| SR-SPEC-09 | Edge cases defined? | ✅ PASS |
| SR-SPEC-10 | Traceability complete? | ✅ PASS |

### Traceability Summary
- Functional Requirements: 8 (FR-001 to FR-008)
- Acceptance Scenarios: 12 (AS-1A to AS-4C)
- Edge Cases: 4 (EC-001 to EC-004)
- Concept Reference: EPIC-001.F01.S01 (or "Standalone")

### Verdict: ✅ PASS
**Reason**: All criteria met, specification ready for planning.

→ Proceeding to handoff: /speckit.plan
```

## Spec Validation Phase (Auto-Triggered)

After Self-Review passes, the `pre_handoff_action` automatically triggers spec validation before handing off to `/speckit.plan`. This catches constitution violations and ambiguities early.

### Validation Flow

```text
1. Self-Review completes with PASS verdict
2. pre_handoff_action triggers:
   - Invoke: /speckit.analyze --profile spec_validate --quiet
   - Timeout: 30 seconds
3. Evaluate validation gates:
   - Constitution Alignment (Pass D): threshold 0, severity CRITICAL
   - Ambiguity Count (Pass B): threshold 5, severity HIGH
4. On gate status:
   - ALL PASS → Proceed to /speckit.plan
   - ANY FAIL → Auto-remediate via /speckit.clarify
```

### Validation Output (Compact)

When spec validation runs, display compact gate results:

```markdown
## Spec Validation Complete

| Gate | Pass | Threshold | Actual | Status |
|------|------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Constitution Alignment | D | 0 | 0 | ✅ |
| Ambiguity Count | B | 5 | 3 | ✅ |

**Result**: PASS

→ Proceeding to handoff: /speckit.plan
```

### On Validation Failure

When gates fail, block handoff and auto-invoke clarify:

```markdown
## Spec Validation BLOCKED

| Gate | Pass | Threshold | Actual | Status |
|------|------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Constitution Alignment | D | 0 | 2 | ❌ FAIL |
| Ambiguity Count | B | 5 | 7 | ⚠️ WARN |

**Result**: FAIL

### Blocking Issues

1. **[CRITICAL] Constitution Violation**: FR-003 conflicts with principle "No External Dependencies Without Approval"
2. **[CRITICAL] Constitution Violation**: AS-2B implies server-side storage, violates "Privacy First" principle

### Extracted Clarification Questions

1. FR-003 references "cloud sync" - does this require explicit user opt-in per constitution?
2. AS-2B stores user data server-side - what anonymization is required?
3. [Plus 5 ambiguity-derived questions from Pass B]

→ Auto-invoking `/speckit.clarify` with 7 extracted questions...
```

### Skip Validation

To bypass spec validation (not recommended):

```bash
# Skip validation gate
/speckit.specify --skip-validate

# Equivalent short form
/speckit.specify --fast
```

When skipped, log warning:

```text
⚠️ Spec validation skipped (--skip-validate). Constitution and ambiguity gates not enforced.
→ Proceeding to handoff: /speckit.plan (unvalidated)
```

### Post-Clarification Loop

After `/speckit.clarify` resolves issues, re-run validation:

```text
1. clarify completes
2. Re-invoke: /speckit.analyze --profile spec_validate --quiet
3. If gates pass → Resume handoff to /speckit.plan
4. If gates fail → Repeat clarification (max 3 iterations)
5. After 3 iterations → Require manual intervention
```
