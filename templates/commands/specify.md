## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Brownfield Detection

**Automatically detect if this is a brownfield project**:

```text
1. Check codebase indicators:
   - git log --oneline | wc -l > 50 commits → BROWNFIELD_SIGNAL
   - src/ OR backend/ OR frontend/ directory exists with .py/.ts/.js/.go files → BROWNFIELD_SIGNAL
   - package.json OR requirements.txt OR go.mod exists → BROWNFIELD_SIGNAL

2. Check user input keywords:
   - Contains: "existing", "modify", "extend", "refactor", "migrate", "upgrade", "fix", "improve"
   - Contains: "current system", "legacy", "brownfield", "existing code", "already have"
   → BROWNFIELD_SIGNAL

3. Check for baseline.md:
   - IF FEATURE_DIR/baseline.md exists → BROWNFIELD_CONFIRMED
   - This file is generated by /speckit.baseline command

4. Determine mode:
   - IF BROWNFIELD_SIGNAL count >= 2 OR BROWNFIELD_CONFIRMED:
     - Set BROWNFIELD_MODE = true
     - Include "Change Specification" section in spec.md
   - ELSE:
     - Set BROWNFIELD_MODE = false
     - Skip "Change Specification" section entirely
```

**When BROWNFIELD_MODE = true**:

1. If baseline.md exists, parse it to auto-populate:
   - Current State Analysis (CB-xxx entries from baseline components)
   - Current Limitations (infer from user description)
   - Initial Change Delta (infer ADD/MODIFY/REMOVE from user intent)

2. If baseline.md does NOT exist, suggest:
   ```text
   💡 Brownfield project detected. Consider running `/speckit.baseline` first
   to capture current system state for better change traceability.

   Proceed without baseline? (Y/N)
   ```

3. Generate appropriate Change Type from user input:
   - "add feature" → Enhancement
   - "refactor" → Refactor
   - "migrate from X to Y" → Migration
   - "fix bug" → Bugfix
   - "optimize", "performance" → Performance
   - "security", "vulnerability" → Security

---

## Concept Integration

**Check for existing concept document**:

1. Look for `specs/concept.md` in the repository root
2. If concept.md exists:
   - Parse the Feature Hierarchy section to find matching Concept IDs
   - The user input may reference Concept IDs directly (e.g., "EPIC-001.F01.S01")
   - Or the user may describe a feature that matches stories in the concept
   - Extract: Vision context, related User Journeys, Dependencies
   - Set `CONCEPT_REFERENCE` to the matched Concept ID(s)
   - Use the concept's priority levels (P1a, P1b) for User Story prioritization

3. If concept.md does NOT exist:
   - Proceed with standalone specification
   - Set `CONCEPT_REFERENCE` to "N/A"
   - Use simple priorities (P1, P2, P3) or sub-priorities as needed

**Concept ID Matching Logic**:

```text
IF user input contains pattern "EPIC-\d+\.F\d+\.S\d+":
  CONCEPT_IDS = extract all matching IDs
  Validate each ID exists in concept.md
ELSE:
  Search concept.md Feature Hierarchy for:
    - Story descriptions that match user input keywords
    - Feature names that match user input
  CONCEPT_IDS = matched story IDs (or "N/A" if no match)
```

## Incomplete Feature Check

Before creating a new feature, check for incomplete work in the feature manifest:

```text
MANIFEST_FILE = specs/features/.manifest.md

IF exists(MANIFEST_FILE):
  Parse manifest table
  Find features with status NOT IN [MERGED, ABANDONED]

  IF incomplete_features.count > 0:
    Display warning:

    ⚠️ **Incomplete Features Detected**

    | ID | Name | Status | Last Updated |
    |----|------|--------|--------------|
    | [list each incomplete feature] |

    **Options**:
    1. **Resume existing**: Run `/speckit.switch <ID>` to continue working on an existing feature
    2. **Start new anyway**: Confirm to proceed with creating a new feature
    3. **Abandon old**: Mark incomplete features as ABANDONED first

    **Note**: Proceeding will create a new feature. Incomplete feature(s) above
    will remain accessible via `/speckit.switch`.

    ASK user: "Do you want to proceed with creating a new feature? (yes/no)"

    IF user confirms:
      CONTINUE to branch creation
    ELSE:
      EXIT with suggestion to use /speckit.switch

ELSE:
  # No manifest exists - this is the first feature
  CONTINUE to branch creation
```

---

## Extension Detection

**Detect if user intent suggests extending an existing feature**:

```text
MERGED_FEATURES = get features from manifest where Status = MERGED

IF MERGED_FEATURES.count > 0:
  Analyze user input for extension patterns:

  PATTERN_KEYWORDS = ["add to", "extend", "enhance", "improve", "update", "modify",
                      "fix in", "change", "refactor", "upgrade", "add feature to"]

  FEATURE_REFERENCES = look for:
    - Direct feature IDs: "001", "feature 001", "#001"
    - Feature names: "login", "auth", "payment"
    - System spec references: "login system", "auth module"

  IF user input matches PATTERN_KEYWORDS AND references existing feature:
    EXTENSION_CANDIDATE = find matching merged feature

    Display suggestion:

    💡 **Extension Opportunity Detected**

    Your description suggests modifying the **{EXTENSION_CANDIDATE}** feature
    which was merged on {MERGE_DATE}.

    **Recommendation**: Use `/speckit.extend` instead to:
    - ✅ Preserve Feature Lineage (traceability)
    - ✅ Auto-load parent context
    - ✅ Track System Spec evolution correctly

    **Example**:
    ```
    /speckit.extend {EXTENSION_CANDIDATE_ID} "{USER_DESCRIPTION}"
    ```

    **Options**:
    1. **Use /speckit.extend** (Recommended) - Creates extension with lineage
    2. **Create standalone feature** - Proceed without lineage (loses traceability)

    ASK user: "Would you like to use /speckit.extend instead? (yes/no)"

    IF user says yes:
      Redirect to: /speckit.extend {EXTENSION_CANDIDATE_ID} "{USER_DESCRIPTION}"
      EXIT
    ELSE:
      CONTINUE to branch creation
      Note: Feature will not have Feature Lineage section populated
```

**Relationship Type Detection**:

```text
Based on description keywords, suggest relationship if extending:

"add", "new", "implement", "support", "enable" → EXTENDS
"improve", "enhance", "optimize", "refactor", "clean" → REFINES
"fix", "bug", "issue", "correct", "patch", "resolve" → FIXES
"replace", "remove", "deprecate", "migrate", "sunset" → DEPRECATES
```

---

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `{ARGS}` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that feature description, do this:

1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:
   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords
   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature
   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., "add-user-auth", "fix-payment-bug")
   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)
   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance
   - Examples:
     - "I want to add user authentication" → "user-auth"
     - "Implement OAuth2 integration for the API" → "oauth2-api-integration"
     - "Create a dashboard for analytics" → "analytics-dashboard"
     - "Fix payment processing timeout bug" → "fix-payment-timeout"

2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:

   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:

      ```bash
      git fetch --all --prune
      ```

   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:
      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`

   c. Determine the next available number:
      - Extract all numbers from all three sources
      - Find the highest number N
      - Use N+1 for the new branch number

   d. Run the script `{SCRIPT}` with the calculated number and short-name:
      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name "your-short-name"` along with the feature description
      - Bash example: `{SCRIPT} --json --number 5 --short-name "user-auth" "Add user authentication"`
      - PowerShell example: `{SCRIPT} -Json -Number 5 -ShortName "user-auth" "Add user authentication"`

   **IMPORTANT**:
   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number
   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern
   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1
   - You must only ever run this script once per feature
   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for
   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot")

3. Load `templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.

4. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user description from Input
       If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"

    2. Extract key concepts from description
       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints

    3. Check Concept Integration (see section above)
       - If concept.md exists: extract CONCEPT_REFERENCE and related context
       - Use concept priorities (P1a, P1b) and dependencies

    4. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience
         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details

    5. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section with **sub-priorities**:
       - If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
       - Assign priorities using sub-levels: P1a, P1b, P1c (MVP critical path), P2a, P2b (post-MVP)
       - Add **Concept Reference** per User Story linking to CONCEPT_IDS
       - Add **Independent Test** description for each story

    6. Generate **Acceptance Scenarios with IDs** in tabular format:

       **ID Format**: `AS-[story number][scenario letter]`
       - Story 1 scenarios: AS-1A, AS-1B, AS-1C
       - Story 2 scenarios: AS-2A, AS-2B
       - Edge cases: EC-001, EC-002

       **Table Structure**:
       ```markdown
       | ID | Given | When | Then |
       |----|-------|------|------|
       | AS-1A | [initial state] | [action] | [expected outcome] |
       ```

       **IMPORTANT**: These IDs will be referenced in tasks.md for traceability:
       - Test tasks will use [TEST:AS-1A] markers
       - This enables end-to-end traceability: Concept → Spec → Tasks → Tests

    7. Generate Functional Requirements with IDs (FR-001, FR-002)
       - Each requirement must be testable
       - Link each FR to relevant Acceptance Scenarios: `*Acceptance Scenarios*: AS-1A, AS-1B`
       - Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions)

    8. Define Success Criteria (SC-001, SC-002)
       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures
       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details

    9. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)

    10. Generate Traceability Summary table:
        ```markdown
        | Requirement | Acceptance Scenarios | Edge Cases | Status |
        |-------------|---------------------|------------|--------|
        | FR-001 | AS-1A, AS-1B | EC-001 | Defined |
        ```

    11. **IF BROWNFIELD_MODE = true**: Generate Change Specification section:

        a) Parse baseline.md (if exists) to extract:
           - Component inventory → CB-xxx entries
           - Current behavior descriptions
           - Code locations (file:line references)

        b) Analyze user description to infer:
           - Current Limitations (CL-xxx) from problem statements
           - Change Delta (CHG-xxx) from desired outcomes
           - Preserved Behaviors (PB-xxx) from "keep existing" / "maintain compatibility" phrases

        c) Generate Change Type from keywords:
           ```text
           IF "migrate" OR "move from" OR "upgrade" → Migration
           ELIF "refactor" OR "restructure" → Refactor
           ELIF "fix" OR "bug" OR "issue" → Bugfix
           ELIF "optimize" OR "performance" OR "speed" → Performance
           ELIF "security" OR "vulnerability" OR "CVE" → Security
           ELSE → Enhancement
           ```

        d) Map changes to requirements:
           - Link each CHG-xxx to relevant FR-xxx
           - Ensure every CL-xxx has at least one CHG-xxx addressing it

        e) IF Change Type = Migration:
           - Generate Migration Plan section
           - Suggest migration strategy based on scope
           - Create placeholder deprecation timeline

        f) Generate Rollback Criteria:
           - Add default metrics: error rate, response time
           - Suggest custom metrics based on feature type

    12. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:

      ```markdown
      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]
      
      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]
      
      ## Content Quality

      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification
      
      ## Notes
      
      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results**:

      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6

      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the spec to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user

      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]
           
           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]
           
           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]
           
           **Suggested Answers**:
           
           | Option | Answer | Implications |
           |--------|--------|--------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |
           
           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

7. Report completion with:
   - Branch name and spec file path
   - Checklist results
   - **Traceability summary**:
     - Concept Reference: [CONCEPT_IDS or "Standalone spec"]
     - Acceptance Scenarios created: N (AS-1A to AS-Nx)
     - Functional Requirements: N (FR-001 to FR-00N)
     - Edge Cases: N (EC-001 to EC-00N)
   - **Brownfield summary** (if BROWNFIELD_MODE = true):
     - Change Type: [Enhancement | Refactor | Migration | Bugfix | Performance | Security]
     - Current Behaviors documented: N (CB-001 to CB-00N)
     - Current Limitations identified: N (CL-001 to CL-00N)
     - Change Deltas specified: N (CHG-001 to CHG-00N)
     - Preserved Behaviors: N (PB-001 to PB-00N)
     - Migration Phases: N (if applicable)
     - Baseline used: [Yes - baseline.md | No - manual entry]
   - Readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`)

**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.

## Concept-to-Spec Workflow

When `specs/concept.md` exists, follow this enhanced workflow:

```text
1. User runs: /speckit.specify EPIC-001.F01.S01, EPIC-001.F01.S02

2. Agent reads concept.md and extracts:
   - Stories: EPIC-001.F01.S01, EPIC-001.F01.S02
   - Parent Feature: EPIC-001.F01 (description, priority, dependencies)
   - Parent Epic: EPIC-001 (goal, context)
   - Related User Journeys (J001, J002 that reference these features)
   - Dependencies from Cross-Feature Dependencies matrix

3. Agent creates spec.md with:
   - **Source Concept**: specs/concept.md
   - **Concept IDs Covered**: EPIC-001.F01.S01, EPIC-001.F01.S02
   - User Stories populated from concept story descriptions
   - Priorities inherited from concept (P1a, P1b)
   - Acceptance Scenarios generated with IDs (AS-1A, AS-1B)

4. Agent updates concept.md Traceability Skeleton:
   | Concept ID | Spec Created | Spec Requirements | Status |
   |------------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
   | EPIC-001.F01.S01 | [x] | FR-001, FR-002 | Specified |
   | EPIC-001.F01.S02 | [x] | FR-003 | Specified |
```

**Benefits**:
- No idea loss: all concept stories are tracked
- Priorities flow from concept to spec
- Dependencies are visible across specs
- Full traceability from Vision → Spec → Tasks → Tests

## General Guidelines

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.
- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience
   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications
   - Lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)
   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)
   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):

- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain
- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified
- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks
- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps
- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise

### Success Criteria Guidelines

Success criteria must be:

1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)
2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools
3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals
4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details

**Good examples**:

- "Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes"
- "System supports 10,000 concurrent users"
- "95% of searches return results in under 1 second"
- "Task completion rate improves by 40%"

**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):

- "API response time is under 200ms" (too technical, use "Users see results instantly")
- "Database can handle 1000 TPS" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)
- "React components render efficiently" (framework-specific)
- "Redis cache hit rate above 80%" (technology-specific)

## Automation Behavior

When this command completes successfully, the following automation rules apply:

### Auto-Transitions

| Condition | Next Phase | Gate |
|-----------|------------|------|
| spec.md valid, no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] | `/speckit.plan` | Spec Quality Gate |

### Quality Gates

| Gate | Check | Block Condition | Message |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------|
| Spec Quality Gate | All checklists/requirements.md items pass | Incomplete items > 0 | "Resolve incomplete checklist items before proceeding" |

### Gate Behavior

**If all conditions pass and no gates block:**
- Automatically proceed to `/speckit.plan` with the created specification
- Log transition for audit trail

**If gates block:**
- Display blocking message to user
- List incomplete checklist items
- Wait for user to resolve issues
