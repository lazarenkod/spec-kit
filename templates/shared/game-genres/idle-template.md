## Technical Requirements

### Engine
- **Recommended**: Unity (2D)
- **Alternative**: Unreal (if high-fidelity 3D needed)

### Backend (Moderate to Complex)
- **Required**:
  - Player progression sync (cloud save)
  - Leaderboards (power rankings, arena)
  - Guild system (matchmaking, chat, wars)
  - Gacha system (server-authoritative, rates)
  - Analytics (GameAnalytics, Firebase)
- **Optional**:
  - PvP matchmaking (ELO, brackets)
  - Live ops (remote config for events)
  - Anti-cheat (server-side validation)

### Platform
- **Primary**: iOS/Android cross-platform
- **Orientation**: Portrait (primary) or Landscape

- **File size**: <500MB (mid-core with assets)

### Performance Targets
- **FPS**: 60 FPS on mid-tier devices (2018+ phones)
- **Load time**: <5 seconds to main game screen
- **Battery usage**: <5% drain per hour (idle mode), <10% per hour (active)

### Analytics Events
- **Critical**: session_start, prestige, hero_summon, level_up
- **Monetization**: iap_purchase, ad_impression, vip_subscribe
- **Retention**: daily_login, quest_complete, guild_joined
- **Progression**: stage_complete, hero_unlock, equipment_craft

## Competitive Positioning

### Strengths (vs Reference Games)
- **Low time commitment**: Check-in gameplay appeals to busy players
- **F2P friendly**: Offline progression allows F2P players to compete
- **Deep progression**: Can play for months/years

### Weaknesses (vs Reference Games)
- **Repetitive**: Core loop can feel samey after weeks
- **P2W concerns**: Whales dominate PvP, guilds
- **Complex meta**: Hard to balance progression for F2P vs payers

### ERRC Grid (Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create)
- **Eliminate**: Excessive UI clutter, confusing menus
- **Reduce**: P2W advantage (AFK Arena = 80% skill, 20% power)
- **Raise**: Offline rewards (12h cap → 24h cap)
- **Create**: Guild PvE content (raid bosses, not just PvP)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
- **P2W backlash**: Overly aggressive monetization alienates F2P
  - **Mitigation**: Balance F2P progression (AFK Arena model)
- **Content treadmill**: Need constant new heroes, events
  - **Mitigation**: Live ops team, remote config for events

### Medium Risks
- **Complex balance**: Hard to balance progression for all player types
  - **Mitigation**: Data-driven tuning, A/B tests
- **Guild management**: Inactive guilds hurt retention
  - **Mitigation**: Guild activity requirements, auto-kick

### Low Risks
- **Technical complexity**: Idle mechanics are simple
  - **Mitigation**: Unity has proven idle game templates
- **Platform rejection**: Low risk if content age-appropriate
  - **Mitigation**: Follow App Store/Play Store guidelines

## Example Concept (Idle Genre)

**Game Title**: "Idle Kingdom: Rise of Heroes"

**Vision**: An idle RPG where players build a fantasy kingdom while auto-battling through dungeons. Collect 200+ heroes from 6 factions (Human, Elf, Orc, Undead, Dragon, Demon). Offline rewards allow players to progress while away. Guild wars and PvP arena provide competitive endgame.

**Unique Twist**: Faction synergy system — teams with same faction get 20-50% bonuses. Players must balance roster diversity vs synergy.

**Monetization**: Hybrid model — Gacha for heroes ($0.99-9.99), VIP pass ($9.99/month for 2x idle speed), Battle Pass ($9.99/season).

**Target Audience**: Mid-core gamers 18-40, RPG fans, progression enthusiasts, busy professionals.

**CQS-Game Estimate**: 95/120 (strong Market, Monetization, Retention; high competition but proven genre)

## Genre Compliance Checklist (Required for CQS-Game v2.0 Validation)

### Core Mechanics (Must-Have)
- [ ] Automated resource generation (accumulates while offline)
- [ ] Strategic upgrades (invest in generators, multipliers, automation)
- [ ] Prestige/rebirth system (reset for permanent bonuses)
- [ ] Active abilities OR tap-to-boost (hybrid idle layer)

### Retention Mechanics (Must-Have)
- [ ] Daily quests (login rewards, quest completion)
- [ ] Offline rewards (8-12 hour accumulation cap)
- [ ] Guild system OR social features (guild wars, donations, chat)

### Monetization (Must-Have for F2P)
- [ ] IAP: Premium currency ($4.99-19.99), Hero summons ($0.99-9.99)
- [ ] IAP: VIP system ($9.99/month for idle speed boost, daily gems)
- [ ] Ads: Rewarded video (2x offline rewards, speed up timers, extra summons)
- [ ] IAP: Starter packs ($0.99-4.99), Event bundles ($19.99-49.99)

### Red Flags (Avoid)
- ❌ No offline rewards (breaks idle genre promise) → Core mechanic violation
- ❌ P2W guild content (F2P players locked out of guilds) → GAM-004 violation
- ❌ No prestige system (progression wall without reset) → Genre expectation violation
- ❌ Excessive complexity (too many currencies, systems) → Cognitive overload

**Validation Logic** (for concept-quality-validator):
- Core mechanics: 100% compliance required
- Retention mechanics: ≥80% required
- Monetization: ≥80% if F2P model
- Genre Fit Score = (Must-Have compliance + Nice-to-Have compliance) / 2
- **Target**: ≥80% for QG-GCONCEPT-002 pass
