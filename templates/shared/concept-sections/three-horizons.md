| Horizon | Time Frame | Focus | Resource Allocation | Risk Profile |
|:-------:|:----------:|-------|:-------------------:|:------------:|
| **H1** | 0-12 months | Defend & extend core business | **70%** | Low |
| **H2** | 12-24 months | Scale emerging opportunities | **20%** | Medium |
| **H3** | 24-36+ months | Create future growth options | **10%** | High |

| [Customer-requested features] | Extend | [X]% | [+X% expansion] | Q[X] |
| [Technical debt reduction] | Defend | [X]% | [+X% velocity] | Q[X] |
| [Security/compliance] | Defend | [X]% | [Risk mitigation] | Ongoing |

### H1 Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target (12mo) | Measurement |
|--------|:-------:|:-------------:|-------------|

| Feature adoption | [X]% | [X]% | Usage analytics |

### H1 Resource Breakdown

| Resource Type | Allocation | Primary Focus |
|---------------|:----------:|---------------|
| Engineering | [X] FTEs | Core product improvements |
| Product | [X] FTEs | Customer feedback → roadmap |
| Support | [X] FTEs | Customer success |

---

## Horizon 2: Emerging Opportunities (20% of Resources)

*Scale emerging opportunities: New features, adjacent markets, new customer segments*

### H2 Initiatives

| Initiative | Opportunity Size | Investment | Stage | Key Milestone |
|------------|:----------------:|:----------:|:-----:|---------------|
| [New market segment] | $[X]M TAM | [X]% | [Discovery/Pilot/Scale] | [Milestone] |
| [New product capability] | [X]% ARR potential | [X]% | [Discovery/Pilot/Scale] | [Milestone] |
| [Platform extension] | [X] partners | [X]% | [Discovery/Pilot/Scale] | [Milestone] |
| [Geographic expansion] | $[X]M SAM | [X]% | [Discovery/Pilot/Scale] | [Milestone] |

### H2 Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target (24mo) | Measurement |
|--------|:-------:|:-------------:|-------------|
| Revenue from new initiatives | $[X]K | $[X]K | MRR attribution |
| New segment customers | [X] | [X] | Segment tagging |
| New feature adoption | [X]% | [X]% | Usage analytics |
| Experiment win rate | [X]% | [X]% | A/B test outcomes |

### H2 Stage-Gate Criteria

| Stage | Investment | Success Criteria | Failure Trigger |
|:-----:|:----------:|------------------|-----------------|
| Discovery | <$[X]K | [X] validated hypotheses | <50% hypothesis pass |
| Pilot | <$[X]K | [X] paying customers | <[X] customers in 90 days |
| Scale | Full investment | Positive unit economics | LTV:CAC <2:1 |

---

## Horizon 3: Future Options (10% of Resources)

*Create future growth options: R&D, new technologies, transformational bets*

### H3 Initiatives

| Initiative | Potential Impact | Investment | Exploration Type | Time to Clarity |
|------------|:----------------:|:----------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|
| [AI/ML capability] | Platform shift | [X]% | Technical R&D | [X] months |
| [Adjacent market] | 10x TAM | [X]% | Market research | [X] months |
| [New business model] | Revenue diversification | [X]% | Business design | [X] months |
| [Technology bet] | Competitive moat | [X]% | Prototype | [X] months |

### H3 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target (36mo) | Measurement |
|--------|:-------------:|-------------|
| Options created | [X] validated opportunities | Portfolio count |
| Tech capabilities | [X] new platform abilities | Capability inventory |
| Learning velocity | [X] experiments/quarter | Experiment log |
| IP/moat development | [X] patents/trade secrets | IP portfolio |

### H3 Exploration Framework

| Question | How We'll Answer | Investment |
|----------|------------------|:----------:|
| "What if [technology X] becomes viable?" | [Prototype / POC] | $[X]K |
| "What if [market Y] emerges?" | [Customer discovery] | $[X]K |
| "What if [competitor Z] disrupts us?" | [Scenario planning] | [X] hours |

## Resource Allocation Summary

### Current State

| Horizon | Recommended | Current | Gap | Action |
|:-------:|:-----------:|:-------:|:---:|--------|
| H1 | 70% | [X]% | [+/-X]% | [Increase/Decrease] |
| H2 | 20% | [X]% | [+/-X]% | [Increase/Decrease] |
| H3 | 10% | [X]% | [+/-X]% | [Increase/Decrease] |

### Resource Allocation Rationale

**Why this split?**
- [H1 allocation rationale: market maturity, competitive pressure, customer needs]
- [H2 allocation rationale: growth opportunities, strategic bets]
- [H3 allocation rationale: future threats, technology shifts, optionality]

**When to revisit?**
- [ ] Quarterly review of horizon balance
- [ ] Major market shift (competitor, technology, regulation)
- [ ] H2 initiative reaches scale (promote to H1)
- [ ] H3 exploration validates (promote to H2)

---

## Horizon Transitions

### Promotion Criteria

| From → To | Trigger | Process |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| H3 → H2 | Validated opportunity (evidence) | Business case, pilot budget |
| H2 → H1 | Proven unit economics, scale | Full resource allocation |

### Demotion/Kill Criteria

| Horizon | Kill Trigger | Process |
|:-------:|--------------|---------|
| H2 | Fails stage-gate 2x | Pivot or kill, redeploy resources |
| H3 | No learning after [X] months | Document learnings, close exploration |

---

## Three Horizons Quality Checklist

- [ ] All three horizons populated with specific initiatives
- [ ] Resource allocation explicitly stated (% or FTEs)
- [ ] H1 initiatives tied to current revenue protection
- [ ] H2 initiatives have clear stage-gate criteria
- [ ] H3 initiatives are true explorations (not roadmap items)
- [ ] Promotion/demotion criteria defined
- [ ] Quarterly review cadence established

---

## Integration Notes

- **Feeds into**: Feature hierarchy (wave prioritization), Risk matrix (strategic risks)
- **Depends on**: Market framework (TAM for H2/H3), Business model canvas (revenue protection for H1)
- **CQS Impact**: Improves Features (+3 pts) and Risk (+2 pts) scores through strategic clarity
