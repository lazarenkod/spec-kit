# Strategic Options Framework (Real Options Valuation)

> **Purpose**: Apply real options thinking to strategic decisions, quantifying the value of flexibility and determining optimal timing for commitments versus preserving optionality.

| Option Type | Description | Value Driver | Typical Exercise Trigger |
|:-----------:|-------------|:------------:|--------------------------|
| **Expand** | Scale up if successful | Upside potential | Market validation signals |
| **Delay** | Wait for information | Uncertainty reduction | Competitive pressure |
| **Abandon** | Exit if unfavorable | Downside protection | Failure thresholds |
| **Pivot** | Switch direction | Strategic flexibility | Market feedback |
| **Stage** | Sequential investment | Learning value | Stage-gate criteria |

## Option Value Assessment

*Simplified option value framework (conceptual Black-Scholes)*

### Option Value Components

| Component | Description | This Concept |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Underlying Value (S)** | Present value of expected cash flows if exercised now | $[X]K |
| **Strike Price (K)** | Investment required to exercise the option | $[X]K |
| **Time to Expiration (T)** | How long until decision must be made | [X] months |
| **Volatility (σ)** | Uncertainty in underlying value | [High/Medium/Low] |
| **Risk-Free Rate (r)** | Cost of capital for comparison | [X]% |

### Option Value Matrix

| Option | In-the-Money? | Time Value | Total Option Value | Priority |
|--------|:-------------:|:----------:|:------------------:|:--------:|
| [Expand to Enterprise] | [Yes: S>K / No: S<K] | [High/Med/Low] | $[X]K | [1-5] |
| [Delay tech decision] | [N/A] | [High/Med/Low] | $[X]K/mo | [1-5] |
| [Abandon threshold] | [N/A - protective] | [High/Med/Low] | $[X]K saved | [1-5] |
| [Pivot to segment Y] | [Yes/No] | [High/Med/Low] | $[X]K | [1-5] |

### Value of Flexibility Score

| Dimension | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted Score |
|-----------|:------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|
| Number of viable options | 20% | [X] | [X] |
| Time until forced decision | 20% | [X] | [X] |
| Cost to preserve optionality | 20% | [X] | [X] |
| Quality of trigger signals | 20% | [X] | [X] |
| Recovery value if wrong | 20% | [X] | [X] |
| **Total Flexibility Score** | 100% | — | **[X]/5** |

## Exercise Triggers & Decision Framework

### Trigger Signal Dashboard

| Option | Leading Indicator | Current Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------------------|:-------------:|:---------:|:------:|
| [Expand] | [Pilot customer count] | [X] | [X] | [Watch/Ready/Exercise] |
| [Expand] | [Unit economics] | [X] | [X] | [Watch/Ready/Exercise] |
| [Delay] | [Competitor announcements] | [X] | [X] | [Wait/Decide] |
| [Abandon] | [Monthly burn vs progress] | [X] | [X] | [Continue/Abandon] |
| [Pivot] | [Customer segment feedback] | [X] | [X] | [Stay/Pivot] |

### Decision Rules

| Scenario | Recommended Action | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| High uncertainty + Low holding cost | **Delay** | Value of information exceeds cost |
| Clear positive signal + Competition | **Expand now** | First-mover advantage, exercise early |
| Clear negative signal | **Abandon/Pivot** | Limit losses, redeploy resources |
| Mixed signals | **Stage investment** | Buy more information cheaply |
| Expiration approaching | **Forced decision** | Evaluate current best information |

## Wait vs. Act Analysis

*Should we commit now or preserve optionality?*

### Current Decision: [Primary strategic choice]

| Factor | Act Now | Wait [X] Months |
|--------|:-------:|:---------------:|
| Expected value | $[X]K | $[X]K |
| Downside risk | $[X]K loss | $[X]K holding cost |
| Information gained | [None] | [Description of learning] |
| Competitive risk | [Low/Med/High] | [Low/Med/High] |
| Resource availability | [Now available] | [May change] |
| Reversibility | [High/Med/Low] | [N/A] |

### Recommendation

**Decision**: [ ] Act Now  [ ] Wait until [Trigger/Date]

**Rationale**: [Why this choice maximizes option value]

**Commitment schedule**:
- Immediate commitment: $[X]K ([X]% of total)
- Conditional commitment: $[X]K (upon [trigger])
- Preserved optionality: $[X]K (decision at [date])

## Integration Notes

- **Feeds into**: Risk matrix (option-based risk mitigation), Three Horizons (H2/H3 as options)
- **Depends on**: Market framework (uncertainty levels), Financial projections (underlying values)
- **CQS Impact**: Improves Risk (+4 pts) and Financial (+3 pts) scores through strategic flexibility quantification
