## Executive Summary Template

### The Ask
[1 sentence: What decision/resources are we requesting?]

**Example**: "We're seeking approval to build [Product] with [X] FTEs over [Y] months to capture the [market opportunity]."

---

### Why Now

[2-3 sentences: Market timing, urgency drivers, competitive window]

**Synthesis from**: Market Framework (timing signals), Porter's Five Forces (competitive pressure), PR/FAQ (customer pain urgency)

| Timing Signal | Evidence | Urgency |
|---------------|----------|:-------:|
| [Market shift] | [Source/data] | HIGH/MED/LOW |
| [Competitive move] | [Source/data] | HIGH/MED/LOW |
| [Technology enabler] | [Source/data] | HIGH/MED/LOW |

---

### The Opportunity

**Synthesis from**: Market Framework (TAM/SAM/SOM), Persona-JTBD (target customer), Business Model Canvas (willingness to pay)

#### Opportunity Framing

| Market Layer | Size | Summary | Validation |
|--------------|:----:|---------|------------|
| **TAM** (Total Addressable) | $[X]B | [One-line: global market for this category] | [Methodology: Top-down/Bottom-up/Value-theory] |
| **SAM** (Serviceable Available) | $[X]M | [One-line: addressable with our go-to-market] | [Filters: Geographic/Segment/Tech constraints] |
| **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable) | $[X]M | [One-line: realistic capture in Year 1-3] | [Capture rate: X% of SAM based on comparable benchmarks] |

**Market Opportunity Grade**: [A/B/C] — [Rationale: venture-scale, niche valuable, lifestyle business]

**Primary Customer**: [Persona name] at [Company type/size]

**Willingness to Pay**: $[X]/[period] validated via [interviews/landing page/surveys]

---

### Our Approach

[2-3 sentences: Core differentiation, how we'll win, key strategic choices]

**Synthesis from**: Three Foundational Pillars, Differentiation Strategy, Blue Ocean Canvas (ERRC grid), PR/FAQ (value proposition)

#### Strategic Positioning

[2-3 sentences synthesizing competitive positioning and strategic moat]

**Example**: "We compete in the [category] but position as the only [unique positioning]. Unlike [Competitor A's approach] or [Competitor B's weakness], we [strategic advantage] through [defensible capability]. Our [X-month/year] head start in [specific moat] creates a winner-take-most dynamic in [segment]."

**Key Differentiators**:
1. [Differentiator 1] — [Why hard to copy] (Time to imitate: [X months])
2. [Differentiator 2] — [Why hard to copy] (Moat type: [Network/Data/Brand/Tech])
3. [Differentiator 3] — [Why hard to copy] (Defensibility: [High/Medium/Low])

---

### Investment Required

**Synthesis from**: Business Model Canvas (cost structure), Technical Hints (complexity estimate)

| Resource | Amount | Duration | Notes |
|----------|:------:|:--------:|-------|
| Headcount | [X] FTEs | [X] months | [Roles needed] |
| Budget | $[X]K | [X] months | [Major cost categories] |
| Opportunity Cost | [What we delay] | [Duration] | [Impact on other initiatives] |

**Total Investment**: $[X]K over [Y] months

### Key Risks & Mitigations

**Synthesis from**: Risk Matrix, Pre-Mortem Analysis, Hypothesis Testing

| # | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Status |

| 3 | [Risk 3] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Mitigation strategy] | Planned/Active |

**Kill Criteria**: If [metric] < [threshold] by [date], we [pivot/kill].
