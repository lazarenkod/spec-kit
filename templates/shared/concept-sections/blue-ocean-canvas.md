# Blue Ocean Strategy Canvas

> **Purpose**: Identify uncontested market space by analyzing which factors to eliminate, reduce, raise, or create compared to industry norms.

## Strategic Canvas: Factor Comparison

Plot your position against the industry on key competitive factors:

| Factor | Industry Average | Our Position | Strategy | Rationale |
|--------|:----------------:|:------------:|:--------:|-----------|
| Price | ●●●○○ | [●○○○○ - ●●●●●] | [E/R/R/C] | [Why this position] |
| Feature Count | ●●●●○ | [●○○○○ - ●●●●●] | [E/R/R/C] | [Why this position] |
| Ease of Use | ●●○○○ | [●○○○○ - ●●●●●] | [E/R/R/C] | [Why this position] |
| Speed/Performance | ●●●○○ | [●○○○○ - ●●●●●] | [E/R/R/C] | [Why this position] |
| Customization | ●●●●○ | [●○○○○ - ●●●●●] | [E/R/R/C] | [Why this position] |
| Integration Depth | ●●○○○ | [●○○○○ - ●●●●●] | [E/R/R/C] | [Why this position] |
| Support Quality | ●●●○○ | [●○○○○ - ●●●●●] | [E/R/R/C] | [Why this position] |
| [Custom Factor 1] | ●●○○○ | [●○○○○ - ●●●●●] | [E/R/R/C] | [Why this position] |
| [Custom Factor 2] | ●○○○○ | [●○○○○ - ●●●●●] | [E/R/R/C] | [Why this position] |

**Strategy Legend**: E = Eliminate, R = Reduce, Ra = Raise, C = Create

## ERRC Grid (Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create)

### ELIMINATE
*Factors the industry competes on but deliver no real value to your target customers*

| Factor | Why Eliminate | Customer Impact |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| [Factor 1] | [Industry assumption that's wrong] | [Removes confusion/cost] |
| [Factor 2] | [Adds complexity without value] | [Simplifies experience] |
| [Factor 3] | [Legacy feature no one uses] | [Focuses product] |

### REDUCE
*Factors that are over-served by the industry relative to customer needs*

| Factor | Current Industry Level | Our Level | Savings/Benefit |
|--------|:----------------------:|:---------:|-----------------|
| [Factor 1] | ●●●●○ | ●●○○○ | [Cost reduction / simplification] |
| [Factor 2] | ●●●●● | ●●●○○ | [Focus resources elsewhere] |
| [Factor 3] | ●●●○○ | ●○○○○ | [Faster time-to-value] |

### RAISE
*Factors that are under-served by the industry but valued by customers*

| Factor | Current Industry Level | Our Level | Customer Value |
|--------|:----------------------:|:---------:|----------------|
| [Factor 1] | ●●○○○ | ●●●●● | [Specific benefit to customer] |
| [Factor 2] | ●●●○○ | ●●●●○ | [Specific benefit to customer] |
| [Factor 3] | ●○○○○ | ●●●○○ | [Specific benefit to customer] |

### CREATE
*Factors the industry has never offered but your customers would value*

| New Factor | Description | Customer Value | Competitive Moat |
|------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| [Factor 1] | [What it is] | [Why customers want it] | [How long until copied] |
| [Factor 2] | [What it is] | [Why customers want it] | [How long until copied] |
| [Factor 3] | [What it is] | [Why customers want it] | [How long until copied] |

## Blue Ocean Summary

### Our Uncontested Space
[1-2 sentence description of the unique market space we occupy that competitors don't address]

### Why Competitors Can't Follow
- [Barrier 1: technical, operational, or strategic]
- [Barrier 2: network effects, data, or partnerships]
- [Barrier 3: brand positioning or customer lock-in]

### Time to Imitation
- **Surface features**: [X] months until competitors copy
- **Core differentiation**: [X] months/years until eroded
- **Sustainable moat**: [What remains defensible long-term]

## Blue Ocean Quality Checklist

- [ ] At least 2 factors to ELIMINATE (not just reduce)
- [ ] At least 1 factor to CREATE (true innovation)
- [ ] Value curve visually distinct from industry
- [ ] RAISE factors directly tied to customer JTBD
- [ ] Competitive barriers identified (not just differentiation)
- [ ] Time to imitation estimated realistically

---

## Integration Notes

- **Feeds into**: PR/FAQ (differentiation claims), Feature hierarchy (what to build/skip)
- **Depends on**: Market framework (competitive positioning), Persona-JTBD (customer values)
- **CQS Impact**: Improves Market (+3 pts) and Features (+2 pts) scores through strategic clarity
