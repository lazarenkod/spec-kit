## Example 1: B2B SaaS Platform Initiative

> **Scenario**: CPO pitching AI-powered analytics platform to Board for Series B funding

### Executive Summary

**TL;DR**: AI analytics platform targeting mid-market SaaS companies, enabling them to reduce churn by 30% and increase upsell revenue by 25%.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Strategic Imperative** | Expand TAM beyond SMB to mid-market ($50M-$500M ARR segment) — unlock 10x larger deals |
| **Market Opportunity** | $450M SOM over 3 years (5% of $9B TAM in SaaS analytics) |
| **Investment Required** | $12M over 18 months (Series B round) |
| **Expected Return** | $25M ARR by Year 3 ($75M valuation at 3x multiple) → 6.2x ROI |
| **Risk Rating** | **Medium** — Competitive market, requires ML expertise hire |
| **Decision Deadline** | Feb 15, 2026 — Delay pushes launch to Q4 (miss seasonal buying window) |
| **Go/No-Go Criteria** | 10 design partners signed by June 2026; 60% show >20% churn reduction in pilot |

### Strategic Context

**Company OKR Alignment**:
- 🎯 **Primary**: O1 "Expand to mid-market" → This IS the vehicle for KR2 (5 mid-market logos by EOY)
- ➕ **Supporting**: O2 "Improve product margin" → ML efficiency reduces support costs by 15%
- ⏳ **Future**: O3 "Build platform ecosystem" → Analytics API unlocks 3rd-party integrations in 2027

**Strategic Fit Score**: **9/10** — Direct alignment with growth strategy; only concern is team distraction from core product.

**Portfolio Context**:
- **Current Products**:
  - SMB Dashboard (mature, 80% gross margin, 5,000 customers)
  - API Platform (growth, 65% gross margin, 200 customers)
- **This Initiative**: AI Analytics (new product line, adjacent TAM)
- **Portfolio Balance**: Shifts from 100% SMB to 70% SMB / 30% Mid-market by 2028

**Cannibalization Risk**: **Low**
- SMB Dashboard customers lack budget for AI features ($49/mo plan)
- Mid-market pricing ($499-$2,999/mo) targets different buyer (VP Analytics vs individual contributor)
- Migration path: Upsell top 10% of SMB base when they graduate to mid-market

### Strategic Trade-offs

**What We're Saying YES To**:
- ✅ **AI/ML Capability**: Differentiate with predictive churn models (competitors have descriptive only)
- ✅ **Mid-Market Focus**: Move upmarket where LTV = $50K vs $2K in SMB

**What We're Saying NO To** (Opportunity Cost):
- ❌ **Mobile App Rewrite**: Deferred to Q3 2026
  - **Impact**: 12% of users request mobile; risk 2-3% churn in mobile-first segments
  - **Rationale**: Mid-market analytics generates 10x revenue per customer vs mobile retention
  - **Mitigation**: Quick mobile web improvements (2-week sprint) to reduce churn to <1%

- ❌ **European Data Residency**: Deferred to 2027
  - **Impact**: Blocks $5M TAM in EU (GDPR-sensitive customers)
  - **Rationale**: US mid-market = $450M SOM, prioritize larger market first
  - **Mitigation**: Partner with EU reseller for initial penetration

**Total Opportunity Cost of Delays**: $7M in foregone revenue (mobile + EU) over 2 years

**Strategic Bet**:
| Assumption | If Wrong | Mitigation |
|------------|----------|------------|
| Mid-market buyers will pay $1,500/mo for AI analytics | Revenue < $10M by Year 2 → ROI negative | Pivot to freemium model at $199/mo; make up volume in upsells |
| We can hire 3 ML engineers within 6 months | Timeline slips 4-6 months | Pre-contract with ML consultancy; convert to FTE after delivery |

### Resource Requirements & Investment Plan

#### Headcount Model

| Phase | Duration | Engineers | ML Engineers | PM | Design | Total FTEs | Loaded Cost |
|-------|----------|:---------:|:------------:|:--:|:------:|:----------:|------------:|
| **Discovery & Design Partners** | 12 weeks | 2 | 1 | 0.5 | 1 | 4.5 | $270K |
| **MVP (10 design partners)** | 20 weeks | 5 | 2 | 1 | 0.5 | 8.5 | $850K |
| **Beta (50 customers)** | 16 weeks | 8 | 3 | 1 | 0.5 | 12.5 | $1.0M |
| **GA Launch** | 12 weeks | 10 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 14 | $840K |
| **Scale (Post-Launch)** | Ongoing | 6 | 1 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 8 | $480K/quarter |

**Peak Headcount**: 14 FTEs in GA Launch phase
**Total Person-Quarters**: 38 FTE-quarters over 18 months

#### Team Composition & Gaps

| Role | Current Available | Needed (Peak) | Gap | Mitigation Plan |
|------|:-----------------:|:-------------:|:---:|-----------------|
| Backend Engineers | 8 | 10 | -2 | Hire 2 senior engineers (Q1 2026) |
| ML Engineers | 0 | 3 | -3 | 🔴 **Critical**: Hire 2, contract 1 consultant |
| Frontend Engineers | 4 | 3 | +1 | Reallocate 1 to mobile team |
| Product Manager | 3 | 1 | +2 | Existing PM (Sarah) owns, 50% allocation |
| Designer | 2 | 1 | +1 | Existing designer (Marcus) supports |

**Hiring Timeline**:
- **ML Engineers**: Reqs open Jan 15 → Hires by Apr 1 (10-week pipeline) → Start May 1
- **Backend Engineers**: Reqs open Feb 1 → Hires by Apr 15 → Start May 1
- **Risk**: ML hiring market is tight (6-month average); consultant backstop reduces risk

#### Budget Breakdown

| Category | Q1 2026 | Q2 2026 | Q3 2026 | Q4 2026 | Q1 2027 | Total |
|----------|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|------:|
| **Engineering Salaries** | $270K | $850K | $1,000K | $840K | $480K | $3,440K |
| **ML Consultant** | $80K | $80K | $40K | $0 | $0 | $200K |
| **Infrastructure (AWS)** | $15K | $30K | $50K | $80K | $120K | $295K |
| **Data Costs (training)** | $20K | $40K | $30K | $20K | $10K | $120K |
| **Sales & Marketing** | $0 | $50K | $150K | $300K | $500K | $1,000K |
| **Contingency (20%)** | $77K | $200K | $254K | $248K | $222K | $1,001K |
| **TOTAL** | **$462K** | **$1,250K** | **$1,524K** | **$1,488K** | **$1,332K** | **$6,056K** |

**Total 18-Month Budget**: $6.06M (within $12M ask — remaining $6M for Year 2 scale)

**Budget Authority**: Series B Board approval required (>$5M initiative)

#### Opportunity Cost Analysis

**Teams Unavailable for Other Work**:

| Team/Person | Current Work | Impact if Reallocated |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Core Platform Team (3 eng) | API v3 Rewrite | API v3 delayed Q2 → Q4 2026 (low risk: no customer deadline) |
| Sarah (PM) | Mobile Roadmap | Mobile ships with interim PM (Emma); may lack vision coherence |

**Quantified Opportunity Cost**:
- API v3 delay: $0 revenue impact (internal refactor, no customer-facing change)
- Mobile delay: $500K potential churn avoidance lost (if mobile app shipped Q2 vs Q3)

**Net Analysis**: Mid-market initiative ROI ($25M ARR) >> opportunity cost ($500K churn risk) → **Proceed**

#### External Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Annual Cost | Risk | Mitigation |
|------------|------|------------:|------|------------|
| AWS SageMaker | Infrastructure | $150K/yr | Vendor lock-in | Design model-agnostic; can migrate to GCP Vertex AI |
| Snowflake | Data Warehouse | $80K/yr | Data pipeline failure | Backup: Migrate to Databricks (2-week effort) |
| OpenAI API | LLM for insights | $60K/yr | API rate limits | Fallback: Self-host Llama 3 (degrades quality 15%) |

**Total External Spend**: $290K annually (included in Infrastructure budget line)

### Decision Gates & Investment Governance

#### Stage-Gate Model

| Gate | Milestone | Success Criteria | Budget Unlocked | Kill Criteria |
|:----:|-----------|------------------|:---------------:|---------------|
| **Gate 0** | Board Approval | This deck approved | $462K (Q1 Discovery) | Strategic fit < 7/10, team unavailable |
| **Gate 1** | Design Partners Signed | 10 partners commit; 8+ show interest in paying | $1,250K (Q2 MVP) | <5 partners signed; partners unwilling to pay >$500/mo |
| **Gate 2** | MVP Validated | 6/10 partners reduce churn >20%; NPS >40 | $1,524K (Q3 Beta) | <4 partners show impact; NPS <20 (product doesn't work) |
| **Gate 3** | Beta Metrics | 30 paying customers @ avg $1,200/mo; NRR >100% | $1,488K (Q4 Launch) | <15 customers; avg price <$800/mo (market won't pay) |
| **Gate 4** | GA Launch | $500K ARR; CAC payback <12mo; Gross margin >60% | $6M (Year 2 Scale) | ARR <$250K; CAC payback >18mo (unit economics broken) |

**Current Gate**: Gate 0 (seeking Board approval for Q1 2026 start)

**Next Decision Point**: March 31, 2026 (Gate 1 review — design partners signed?)

#### Pre-Commitment Experiments (Before Full Build)

**Before committing $6M, validate core assumptions**:

| Hypothesis | Experiment | Success Metric | Cost | Timeline |
|------------|------------|----------------|:----:|----------|
| Mid-market buyers care about churn prediction | Customer interviews (20 VPs of Analytics) | 15/20 say "this is a top 3 problem" | $10K | 4 weeks |
| Buyers will pay $1,000-$2,000/mo | Pricing survey + mock purchase | 50% choose $1,500 tier; 20% choose $2,500 tier | $5K | 2 weeks |
| Our ML models can predict churn >70% accuracy | POC with 3 friendly customers' data | 2/3 show >70% precision/recall | $50K (consultant) | 8 weeks |

**Total Experiment Cost**: $65K (vs $6M full build — **92x cheaper to learn**)

**Go/No-Go After Experiments** (By Feb 28, 2026):
- ✅ If all 3 hypotheses validated → **GO** (proceed to Gate 1 with design partners)
- ⚠️ If 2/3 validated → **PIVOT** (adjust pricing or positioning based on findings)
- ❌ If <2 validated → **KILL** (save $6M; reallocate to European expansion instead)

#### Kill Criteria (When to Stop)

**Automatic KILL if**:

| Condition | Measurement | Check Frequency | Who Decides |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Design partner adoption <50% | 5/10 partners don't activate product | Monthly (Q2) | CPO + GM |
| NPS <20 after 3 months | User survey | Monthly | CPO |
| ML accuracy <60% | Model performance dashboard | Weekly | CTO |
| CAC >$15K | Marketing spend / new customers | Monthly (post-launch) | CFO + CMO |
| Key ML engineer quits | Team changes | Event-driven | CTO (hire replacement or pivot to rules-based model) |

**Kill Decision Authority**:
- <$1M sunk cost: CPO can kill unilaterally
- $1M-$3M sunk cost: CPO + CFO + CEO approval
- >$3M sunk cost: Board notification required (emergency meeting)

**Sunk Cost Discipline**:
- Already spent at Gate 3: $3.2M
- Remaining budget: $2.8M
- If killed at Gate 3, **save $2.8M** → Reallocate to higher-confidence initiatives

#### Pivot Triggers (Course Corrections, Not Kills)

**PIVOT (adjust strategy) if**:

| Trigger | Pivot Direction | Resource Impact |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Mid-market price tolerance = $500-$800/mo (not $1,500) | Launch freemium tier; upsell premium features | No budget change; adjust revenue targets to $12M (was $25M) |
| SMB customers unexpectedly show high interest | Dual SKU strategy: SMB @ $199/mo, Mid-market @ $1,299/mo | +$200K for SMB-specific UI simplifications |
| ML accuracy plateaus at 65% (below 70% target) | Hybrid model: ML + rule-based fallback; market as "80% accurate" | -$100K (reduce ML R&D); reallocate to UX polish |

**Pivot Authority**: CPO + CTO (with Board notification within 30 days)

### Success Criteria: Multi-Horizon

#### 6-Month Success (Design Partner Validation)

**Primary Goal**: Prove **Problem-Solution Fit** with 10 mid-market design partners

| Metric | Target | Baseline | Stretch | Measurement |
|--------|-------:|:--------:|:-------:|-------------|
| **Design Partners Signed** | 10 | 0 | 15 | Contracts signed by May 31, 2026 |
| **Active Users per Partner** | ≥5 | 0 | ≥10 | Weekly active users in product |
| **Churn Reduction** | ≥20% | 0% | ≥30% | Compare 3-month churn before/after |
| **NPS** | ≥40 | N/A | ≥60 | Post-pilot survey (would recommend?) |
| **Willingness to Pay** | ≥60% | 0% | ≥80% | % of partners committing to paid contract |

**Qualitative Success Signals**:
- ✅ At least 3 partners say "This saved us $X in churn"
- ✅ Unsolicited feature requests (indicates engagement)
- ✅ 1+ partner willing to be public reference customer

**Kill Criteria** (if NOT achieved by June 30, 2026):
- <5 partners signed → Product-market fit doubt
- Churn reduction <10% → Product doesn't work
- Willingness to pay <30% → Pricing/value prop broken

**Decision at 6mo**: GO to Beta (Gate 3) or PIVOT pricing/positioning

#### 1-Year Success (Beta → GA Launch)

**Primary Goal**: Prove **Product-Market Fit** + **Business Model Viability**

| Metric | Target | Current | Stretch | Industry Benchmark |
|--------|-------:|:-------:|:-------:|-------------------:|
| **ARR** | $1.5M | $0 | $2.5M | N/A (new product) |
| **Paying Customers** | 50 | 0 | 80 | Top decile: 100+ |
| **Avg Contract Value (ACV)** | $30K | $0 | $40K | Mid-market SaaS: $25K-$50K |
| **Gross Margin** | ≥65% | N/A | ≥70% | SaaS industry: 70-80% |
| **CAC Payback Period** | ≤12 months | N/A | ≤9 months | Healthy SaaS: 12-18mo |
| **NPS** | ≥50 | N/A | ≥70 | SaaS leaders: 60-80 |

**Unit Economics Validation**:

| Metric | Target | Calculation | Health Check |
|--------|-------:|-------------|--------------|
| **LTV** (Lifetime Value) | $150K | ACV × (1 / Churn%) × Gross Margin | ✅ $30K × (1/20%) × 70% = $105K (conservative) |
| **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost) | $15K | Sales/Marketing spend per customer | Target: $15K (based on $750K marketing ÷ 50 customers) |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | ≥3:1 | LTV / CAC | ✅ $105K / $15K = 7:1 (excellent) |
| **Gross Margin** | ≥65% | (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue | ✅ 65% target (AWS costs <35%) |

**Competitive Benchmarks** (vs Competitors):

| Dimension | Us (Target) | Competitor A (ChurnZero) | Competitor B (Gainsight) | Position |
|-----------|:-----------:|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|----------|
| **Churn Prediction Accuracy** | 70% | 55% (rules-based) | 60% (basic ML) | 🎯 Leader |
| **Time to Value** | <30 days | 60-90 days | 90+ days | 🎯 Leader |
| **Pricing** | $1,500/mo | $2,000/mo | $3,000+/mo | 🎯 Value leader |
| **Mid-Market Focus** | ✓ | ✗ (Enterprise) | ✗ (Enterprise) | 🎯 Niche leader |

**Pivot/Scale Decision at 12 Months**:

- ✅ **If ARR >$1.5M, LTV:CAC >3:1**: **SCALE** → Unlock Year 2 budget ($6M), hire 10+ sales reps
- ⚠️ **If ARR $1M-$1.5M, LTV:CAC 2-3:1**: **OPTIMIZE** → Improve conversion, extend runway 6mo
- 🔄 **If ARR $500K-$1M**: **PIVOT** → Adjust ICP (maybe SMB tier at $199/mo?), pricing, or features
- ❌ **If ARR <$500K**: **KILL** → Market doesn't exist at scale; redeploy team to core product

#### 3-Year Success (Market Leadership)

**Primary Goal**: Become **Top 3 Player** in mid-market SaaS analytics

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|-------:|-----------|
| **ARR** | $25M - $35M | 5-7% of $450M SOM; 0.3% of $9B TAM |
| **Customers** | 500-700 | $35K-$50K ACV per customer |
| **Market Share** | Top 3 | #1 ChurnZero ($50M), #2 Gainsight ($1B enterprise), #3 Us ($25M mid-market) |
| **Brand NPS** | ≥60 | Industry leader benchmark for mid-market SaaS |
| **Net Dollar Retention (NDR)** | ≥110% | Indicates healthy upsell/expansion |
| **Rule of 40** | ≥40% | (Growth% + Profit Margin%) ≥ 40% |

**Strategic Outcomes**:
- ✅ **Market Position**: Recognized as "best mid-market churn analytics platform" (G2 #1 ranking)
- ✅ **Moat Established**:
  - **Data network effect**: 500+ customers → Better ML models → Higher accuracy → More customers
  - **Integration ecosystem**: 50+ native integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, Stripe, etc.)
- ✅ **Ecosystem Built**:
  - 10+ SI partners (implementation services)
  - 3+ OEM partnerships (white-label for adjacent platforms)
  - 5,000+ community members (Slack, events)
- ✅ **Team Scaled**: 50 FTEs (20 Eng, 15 Sales, 10 CS, 5 Ops), <10% attrition
- ✅ **Platform Ready**: Analytics API → Unlock adjacent markets (marketing automation, support ticket analytics)

**Financial Model (3-Year Projection)**:

| Metric | Year 1 (2026) | Year 2 (2027) | Year 3 (2028) | CAGR |
|--------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:----:|
| **ARR** | $1.5M | $8M | $25M | 433% |
| **Customers** | 50 | 200 | 600 | 277% |
| **Gross Margin** | 65% | 70% | 72% | +7pp |
| **Burn Rate** | -$1.5M/mo | -$800K/mo | -$200K/mo → Break-even Q4 | N/A |
| **Valuation (est.)** | $15M (10x ARR, early) | $40M (5x ARR, growth) | $75M (3x ARR, approaching profitability) | 149% |

**Board/Investor Outcomes**:
- Series B ($12M @ $50M pre) → Series C readiness ($75M post-money valuation)
- Path to profitability visible by Year 3 (break-even Q4 2028)
- **Exit scenarios**:
  - Acquisition by CRM platform (Salesforce, HubSpot) at $100M-$150M (3-5x ARR)
  - Continue to Series C, target $100M ARR by 2030

---

### Leading vs Lagging Indicators

**Leading Indicators** (predict ARR growth 3-6 months out):

| Indicator | Target | Why It Predicts Success |
|-----------|-------:|-------------------------|
| **Product Qualified Leads (PQL)** | 200/mo | Users who complete key action (connect data source) convert to paid at 30% |
| **Feature Adoption (Churn Prediction)** | 80% | Customers using core feature renew at 95%; those who don't renew at 60% |
| **Expansion Pipeline** | $500K | Upsells from existing customers → NDR >100% |

**Lagging Indicators** (measure outcomes, but react slower):

| Indicator | Target | Frequency |
|-----------|-------:|-----------|
| **ARR** | $1.5M (Year 1) | Monthly |
| **Logo Churn** | <15% annually | Monthly |
| **Gross Margin** | >65% | Quarterly |

**Decision Rule**: If PQL >200/mo sustained for 3 months BUT ARR growth <10% MoM → **Conversion funnel issue** (fix sales process, pricing, or onboarding)

---

### Organizational Health Metrics

**Success includes sustainable team performance**:

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|:------:|----------------|
| **Employee Engagement (eNPS)** | ≥40 | ML team retention critical (hard to replace); eNPS <20 = attrition risk |
| **Voluntary Attrition** | <12% annually | Industry avg 13%; target slightly better (good culture + equity upside) |
| **Promotion Rate** | 15% annually | Career growth = retention (especially ML engineers with external demand) |
| **Sprint Velocity (Stable)** | ±15% variance | Detect burnout early (velocity drops >20% = team overloaded) |

**Red Flags** (unsustainable execution):
- ⚠️ Attrition >20% → **Immediate action**: Conduct stay interviews, adjust comp, reduce workload
- ⚠️ eNPS <20 → **Leadership issue**: Address culture/management before scaling team
- ⚠️ Velocity drops >25% → **Technical debt or scope creep**: Re-baseline roadmap, cut features

## Example 2: Mobile App Transformation (B2C)

> **Scenario**: CPO pitching mobile-first pivot to CEO/Board (company currently web-only)

### Executive Summary

**TL;DR**: Rebuild mobile app from scratch to capture 40% of users who prefer mobile; expected to drive 25% increase in DAU and 15% reduction in churn.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Strategic Imperative** | **Defensive** — Competitors shipping mobile-first; we're losing mobile-native users (18-35 demo) |
| **Market Opportunity** | Retain $5M ARR at risk + Unlock $12M new ARR from mobile-first segments |
| **Investment Required** | $3.2M over 12 months |
| **Expected Return** | $17M retained/gained ARR → 5.3x ROI |
| **Risk Rating** | **Medium-High** — Mobile dev expertise gap; iOS/Android fragmentation |
| **Decision Deadline** | Jan 31, 2026 — Competitor launching mobile v2.0 in March; we need head start |
| **Go/No-Go Criteria** | Beta shows 50% increase in mobile DAU; mobile NPS >50 (parity with web) |

*(Full example continues with same structure as Example 1...)*

## Example 3: Enterprise Security Compliance Initiative

> **Scenario**: CTO pitching SOC 2 + ISO 27001 compliance to unlock enterprise sales

### Executive Summary

**TL;DR**: Achieve SOC 2 Type II + ISO 27001 certification to unlock $50M+ enterprise pipeline currently blocked by security requirements.

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Strategic Imperative** | **Revenue Unlock** — 23 enterprise deals ($50M TCV) stalled due to compliance gaps |
| **Market Opportunity** | $50M immediate pipeline + $200M TAM in regulated industries (healthcare, finance) |
| **Investment Required** | $1.8M over 9 months (consulting + infrastructure + audits) |
| **Expected Return** | Close 40% of stalled deals ($20M) in Year 1 → 11x ROI |
| **Risk Rating** | **Low** — Well-defined path; primarily execution risk |
| **Decision Deadline** | Feb 1, 2026 — Q1 audit kickoff required for Q3 certification (enterprise sales cycles) |
| **Go/No-Go Criteria** | SOC 2 Type II audit passed by Aug 2026; 5+ enterprise logos closed by Dec 2026 |

**Strategic Context**:
- **Primary OKR**: O1 "Expand to Enterprise" → KR1 "Close 10 logos >$500K ACV"
- **Blocker**: 23/30 enterprise prospects require SOC 2 (76% of pipeline)
- **Competitive Gap**: 3/4 competitors already certified; we're losing deals

**What We're Saying NO To**:
- ❌ Product Feature Development slows 20% (security hardening takes priority)
  - **Impact**: Q2 roadmap ships 2 features instead of 3
  - **Rationale**: $50M pipeline >> $2M from incremental features

*(Full example continues...)*

## Summary: What Makes Concepts "Executive-Ready"

### The 10 Commandments of Executive Concept Documents

1. **Lead with the Ask**: Decision request in first 30 seconds
2. **Show Strategic Alignment**: Explicit linkage to company OKRs/strategy
3. **Quantify Everything**: Market size, investment, ROI, risk — all with numbers
4. **Present Alternatives**: Show what you're NOT doing and why
5. **Stage the Investment**: Tranched funding with gates, not all-or-nothing
6. **Define Kill Criteria**: Executives need off-ramps, not just go/go decisions
7. **Multi-Horizon Success**: 6mo validation, 1yr PMF, 3yr leadership goals
