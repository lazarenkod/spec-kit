| In-app tooltips and hints | +2% | P1 |
| Welcome video (<2 min) | +2% | P2 |

**Onboarding Email Sequence**:

| Day | Email | Goal |
|-----|-------|------|
| 0 | Welcome + quick start guide | First login |
| 1 | "Create your first spec in 5 minutes" | Activation |
| 3 | Template showcase | Value discovery |
| 5 | Success story + best practices | Inspiration |
| 7 | "Need help?" + calendar link | Support |

#### Stage 3: Activated -> Paying (Target: 20%)

**Triggers for Upgrade Prompts**:
- 5+ specs created (hitting free tier limit)
- Team collaboration attempt
- Private spec request
- Advanced template access

**Pricing Page Optimization**:

| Element | Test | Expected Impact |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| Pricing anchor | Show Enterprise first vs Pro first | +5-10% Pro selection |
| Annual toggle | Default to annual with savings shown | +20% annual |
| Feature comparison | Expandable vs always visible | +3% conversion |
| Money-back guarantee | 14 days vs 30 days | +2% conversion |

**Conversion Tactics**:
1. **Time-limited trial**: 14-day Pro trial, then downgrade
2. **Usage-based prompts**: "You've created 5 specs! Upgrade for unlimited"
3. **Team prompts**: "Invite teammates and get 20% off"
4. **Enterprise triggers**: Detect company size, route to sales

#### Stage 4: Paying -> Retained (Target: 90%)

**Churn Prevention**:

| Signal | Intervention |
|--------|--------------|
| No activity in 7 days | "We miss you" email with tips |
| Spec creation declining | Success manager outreach |
| Support ticket spike | Proactive CS call |
| Payment failed | Dunning email sequence |

**Expansion Triggers**:
- Team size growth (add seats)
- Spec volume increase (usage tier)
- New team/department onboarding (enterprise)

Month 3: 82% (Process churn - workflow didn't stick)
Month 6: 80% (Flattening - retained customers are stable)
Month 12: 78% (Long-term retention)
```

**Target Improvement**:
- Month 1: 90% -> 95% (better qualification)

## Appendix B: Competitive Positioning

### Positioning Statement

**For** development teams and startups
**Who** need to build software faster with AI
**Spec Kit** is an open-source development toolkit
**That** provides structured, specification-first AI development
**Unlike** vibe coding tools (Lovable, Bolt.new, Cursor)
**We** deliver predictable, reproducible, enterprise-ready outcomes

### Competitive Battlecard

| Dimension | Spec Kit | Lovable | Bolt.new | Cursor |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Price** | Free OSS + $29+ | $25/mo + credits | $20/mo + tokens | $20/mo + credits |
| **Approach** | Spec-first structured | Prompt-and-pray | Prompt-and-pray | Code assist |
| **Predictability** | High (reproducible) | Low (iterative) | Low (iterative) | Medium |
| **Team Ready** | Yes (version control) | Limited | Limited | Yes |
| **Enterprise** | Roadmap | Limited | Limited | Yes |
| **Lock-in** | None (OSS) | Platform | Platform | IDE |

### Win/Loss Themes

**Why We Win**:
1. Free and open source (no credit/token anxiety)
2. Structured, reproducible workflow
3. Works with existing AI tools (Claude, Copilot)
4. Team collaboration built-in
5. Enterprise-ready governance

**Why We Lose**:
1. More upfront work (spec creation)
2. Not "instant" like vibe coding tools
3. Requires developer mindset
4. Less "magical" first experience
5. CLI-based (not visual)
