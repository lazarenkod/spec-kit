## 📞 Questions & Feedback

### Common Questions

**Q: Why 85% time savings? Seems optimistic.**
A: Based on automation of 4 manual research phases (market, competitive, persona, trend). Each phase currently takes 1-2 hours. AI agents complete in 30-60 seconds each (parallel execution = 2-3 minutes total research time). Human review/refinement adds 30-60 minutes. Total: <1 hour vs 4-8 hours manual.

**Q: What if AI hallucinates market data (bad TAM)?**
A: Mitigation: (1) Require ≥2 sources for all quantitative claims, (2) Cross-validate bottom-up vs top-down TAM, (3) Mark low-confidence estimates as [Assumption], (4) Human review gate (PM must approve).

**Q: Is $55K investment justified for 93-concept break-even?**
A: Yes, if 20 projects adopt (5 concepts each = 100 total). Spec-Kit has growth trajectory to reach this in 6-12 months. After break-even, ROI is 4,900% annually (year 2+).

**Q: What about responsible AI compliance costs?**
A: Built into Phase 2 ($15K). EU AI Act compliance requires risk assessments for high-risk AI. Automating this prevents $50K-100K in external consulting fees per AI product.

**Q: Can we start with just Phase 1, skip Phase 2/3?**
A: Yes, phases are modular. Phase 1 delivers core value (time savings). Phase 2 (AI safety) only applies to AI products. Phase 3 (monitoring) is optional (20% adoption expected).
